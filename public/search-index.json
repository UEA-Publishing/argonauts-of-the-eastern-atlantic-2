One way of understanding the title of Malinowksi’s book is to regard the islanders as early twentieth-century equivalents of the sailors who crewed the <em>Argo</em> of Ancient Greek myth, a ship captained by Jason and protected by the Gods. But <em>Argonauts</em> was not the only book published in 1922 to adopt a classicising title – James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> – a central text in the canon of literary modernism – transposed the voyages and adventures of Odysseus, chronicled in Homer’s Odyssey, onto an ordinary day in Dublin, with Leopold Bloom as its hero.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A worn copy of Ulysses by James Joyce, featuring a blue cover with white lettering, resting on a flat surface.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-3.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ulysses by James Joyce, first edition published in 1922</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A worn copy of Ulysses by James Joyce, featuring a blue cover with white lettering, resting on a flat surface.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-3.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ulysses by James Joyce, first edition published in 1922</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Modernism as an aesthetic and literary movement was consolidated in the years after the First World War – a period in which the world was essentially remade. In 1922, after around 750 years as a centre of English power, Dublin became the capital of the independent Irish Free State.  Old ideas and established authorities were challenged as a new generation of men, Malinowksi and Joyce among them, asserted themselves. If the <em>Argonauts</em> were the Kiriwinans of the Kula ring, then it seems that like Leopold Bloom in <em>Ulysses</em>, Malinowski was the modern(ist) Jason – the legendary hero tasked with bringing back the golden fleece.</p>\n<p>It helps here to know that one of the major works of anthropology before the First World War was <em>The Golden Bough</em> by James Frazer, originally published in two volumes in 1890, three volumes in 1900 and an incredible twelve volumes in the third edition between 1906 and 1915. Frazer’s comparative compendium of mythology developed in relation to the <em>Rex Nemorensis</em>, the priest-king of the sacred grove on the shores of Lake Nemi in Italy.</p>\n<p>In order to become the priest-king, one had to kill the existing priest in combat, after taking the golden bough from one of the trees in the sacred grove. Frazer suggested that the institution of the death and reinstallation of the priest-king was an embodiment of the dying and reviving solar god, central to mythological ideas all over the world – including the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>\n<p>Malinowski himself had been inspired to become an anthropologist by reading <em>the Golden Bough</em> in three volumes, borrowed from the University of Cracow library:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I realised then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact sister studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Frazer was the reigning priest-king of early twentieth-century British Anthropology, Malinowski’s publication of <em>Argonauts</em> can be read as him presenting his own golden bough. In asking James Frazer to write book’s preface, Malinowski was essentially asking for the inauguration of his own reign – like Jason claiming his rightful place as king following presentation of the golden fleece. Malinowski is remembered for developing the notion of the charter myth, and he certainly deployed the myth of his fieldwork in the Trobriands as a charter from which to establish Social Anthropology as a new approach.</p>\n<p>The Golden Bough_ was also a significant influence on Joyce (as well as T.S. Eliot, who published <em>The Waste Land</em> in 1922), as well as other modernists such as Joseph Conrad. Indeed, Malinowski admired Conrad, a fellow Pole, telling Brenda Seligman that ‘Rivers is the Rider Haggard of Anthropology, I shall be his Conrad!’ (Young 2004, 236). By aligning W.H.R. Rivers (who died in 1922) with Rider Haggard, Malinowski was suggesting he exemplified an imperial tradition of British writing about the non-European ‘other’ which he hoped to overturn in the way Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> upended romantic Imperial narratives into a denunciation of colonialism, highlighting the ways it dehumanised the Europeans who participated in it.</p>\n<p>Although Malinowski presented his work as inaugurating something of a revolution in Anthropology, his approach was significantly shaped by his engagement with Frazer, providing at the very least an explanation for the title of his book. In the same way that Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is structured around the story of a European’s voyage to the interior of the African continent, where he comes to dominate and rule, Malinowski’s account, while ostensibly about the Kula, also emphasises his own heroic role as an ethnographer who gains an understanding of the operation of Kula that is essentially superior to that of those who participate in it. This is an anthropological version of ‘the hero’s journey’ myth – explored by Joseph Campbell’s 1949 book, <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em> (a major influence on George Lucas’ Star Wars franchise and not unrelated to what Teju Cole, in 2012, called ‘the White-Saviour Industrial complex’).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A dark, historical image captures a group of individuals seated inside a tent, with figures standing outside amidst tropical vegetation.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bronislaw Malinowski in his tent in the Trobriands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A dark, historical image captures a group of individuals seated inside a tent, with figures standing outside amidst tropical vegetation.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-4.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bronislaw Malinowski in his tent in the Trobriands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A coastal settlement with huts among palm trees, set against a lush jungle backdrop.

It was not uncommon for mid-century Europeans to see themselves as the ones who ‘really’ understood artistic or ceremonial practices in other parts of world. Although twentieth-century Social Anthropology has long been recognised as a modernist form of <em>Writing Culture</em> (Clifford and Marcus 1986), the fact is that <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em> is still widely regarded as an exemplary ethnographic text.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Malinowski’s description of romantically isolated fieldwork remains the standard against which many doctoral anthropology students measure their own efforts, suggesting it has been hard for the discipline to escape the dominating and perhaps domineering influence of the modernists, whose charter myths continue to position them as founding ancestors, or priest-kings in the cult of Social Anthropology.</p>\n<p>For all Malinowksi’s iconoclastic ambitions, the narrative structure of his account betrays a continuity with older European accounts of encounter with other parts of the world. It is striking that central targets for the Modernist generation, from which they sought to distance themselves, perhaps as a result of the what Freud in 1917 called the ‘narcissism of small differences’, were missionaries, but also the museum collections – assembled by anthropological museums during the previous thirty years.</p>\n<p>Modernist anthropologists railed against what they represented as ‘conjectural history’ – the efforts of those who attempted to build frameworks for human history extending beyond the European old world on the basis of facts and artefacts assembled in Europe – an approach increasingly derided as ‘armchair anthropology’. Modernism, and anthropological modernism in particular, was unrelentingly presentist (Fardon 2005). The aim was to explain the operation of society by reference to its contemporary features and characteristics, in the way an anatomist might explain the function of different organs of the body without reference to their evolutionary history.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Cover of Trobriand Cricket.

His access to the field, like that of many anthropologists of his generation was made substantially possible by established networks of Christian missionaries who had operated in Africa and the Pacific for over a century. In the case of the Trobriands, the Methodist missionary M.K. Gilmour had already been stationed at Kiriwina for 14 years when Malinowski arrived in 1915 (Young 1984, 17). Many of Malinowski’s immediate predecessors, the first generation of professional anthropologists, found employment in museums filled by collections assembled in Europe largely through the efforts of previous generations of missionaries.</p>\n<p>In <em>the Right to Look- a counterhistory of visuality</em>, Nicholas Mirzoeff (2011) has suggested that the missionary can be regarded as the metonymic figure of what he called the ‘Imperial Complex of Visuality’, dominant between 1860 and 1945 – as heroes who brought ‘Light into Darkness’ as part of a global “pastorate”. This draws on Michel Foucault’s insight that many of the technologies of governmentality of the modern state were assimilated from forms of Christian pastoral power (Goulder 2007). Thus an enquiry into missionary practice and image making has the potential to illuminate what Talal Asad (2003) has called <em>Formations of the Secular.</em></p>\n<p>Historians such as Boyd Hilton (1988) have demonstrated the significant influence that the 18th century evangelical revival had on British intellectual and cultural forms during the nineteenth century. I would go as far as to suggest that the public museums that took shape in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as part of what Tony Bennett (1988) has called the ‘exhibitionary complex’, can be regarded as an expansion of the ‘missionary exhibitionary complex’ which developed in evangelical circles earlier in the century. My intention in presenting chronologically ordered chapters is to provide a more detailed insight into the development of these related exhibitionary complexes.</p>\n<p>However, I remain conscious of the textual form I am creating – it would easy to describe a narrative arc from origin, through rise, to decline and fall. But would this simply be an appealing way to shape a story out of the messy details of historical events and sources? A Foucauldian genealogy might trace relationships of descent and alliance, but my intention here is less to construct a genealogy than to provide a gallery of ancestral portraits, which the reader/viewer is encouraged to explore in order to recognise and identify family resemblances.</p>\n<p>Marilyn Strathern (1990) has described the typical approach of modernist anthropology to both artefacts and events as one that makes sense of them in relation to a context. She has contrasted this with what she has called a Melanesian approach to images, whether events or artefacts, as embodying history themselves – they do not need to be “explained” by reference to events outside themselves, but are known by their effects. An image or artefact, when approached as a <em>prestation</em> (or gift) demands reciprocation, so that it comes to be understood through the construction of further artefacts in order to see what their further effects will be, with revelations coming as something of a surprise.</p>\n<p>I would collapse Strathern’s dichotomy between the Melanesian and European approaches (which is itself essentially Modernist) by suggesting that the texts constructed to make sense of things by “Europeans”, by which she essentially means modernist anthropologists (Strathern recognises that museum curators are more like “Melanesians” than her “Europeans”) are artefacts themselves, containing their own contexts. In a world in which the British Library is a distinct institution from the British Museum, we might think of texts as unlike other artefacts, but it is in fact not long since they were part of a single institution (1973). Indeed, most libraries contain artefacts that could happily form part of a museum collection, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>One can read Malinowski’s text as an artefact of a particular type, constructed to evoke a context for the Kula that will allow himself and other Europeans to make sense of it. But typically, the institutions of human life do not come with such manuals. One joins the game of life in the midst of play, and learns the rules by watching and joining in. In Roy Wagner’s (1981) terms, Malinowski, as the ethnographer, “invents” the culture of the Trobriands through the construction of his text(s). Strathern suggests that as part of the modernist approach to Anthropology “it is taken for granted that we study the significance which such artefacts have for the people who make them, and thus their interpretations of them”, but if these assumptions were at least identifiable by 1990, I suggest they should no longer be taken for granted.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close-up of a decorative textile featuring circular coral and shell beads, strung together with dark thread on a blue fabric base.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Soulava kula valuable, collected by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">British Museum 20122037.1</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Close-up of a decorative textile featuring circular coral and shell beads, strung together with dark thread on a blue fabric base.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-7.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Soulava kula valuable, collected by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">British Museum 20122037.1</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>A hundred years after the publication of Malinowksi’s <em>Argonauts</em>, I am seeking to revisit the moment of possibility represented by 1922, a return to what Michael North (1999) has called the ‘scene of the modern’. While the COVID19 pandemic has been very different to the First World War, it nevertheless provides a break from business as usual which makes it possible to consider alternative ways of approaching things.</p>\n<p>How best can one write about human life in a way that resists the urge to endlessly contextualise – a tendency to lapse into an essentially theological mode of writing that attempts to elucidate what Malinowski liked to call ‘the native’s point of view’?  Who are /were ‘the natives’ in encounters between missionaries and the people they worked with, and did they really have a single point of view? Is it possible to capture the contingency, uncertainty and provisional nature of much of human life by constructing our accounts differently?</p>\n<p>David Graeber and David Wengrow (2021; 5, 24) have recently challenged us to write history ‘as if it consisted of people one would have been able to talk to, when they were still alive’ as part of an attempt to construct a new science of history that ‘restores our ancestors to their full humanity’. It is to this challenge that I have attempted to respond.</p>\n<p>In his work on the encounters between missionaries and the Yoruba, in what is now Nigeria, J.D.Y. Peel (1995; 2000) drew attention to the centrality of narratives, both in terms of how they structure historical accounts, but also the way in which they were used by participants in these encounters to make sense of their own experiences.</p>\n<p>In response to the work of the Comaroffs (1991, 1997), whose work concentrated on the connections between missionary encounters and the expansion of global capitalism, Peel has suggested that accounts of missionary encounters that do not recognise the centrality of religious narratives runs the risk of reading like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.</p>\n<p>World religions like Christianity, Peel (1995, 9) suggests, are long <em>durée</em> ‘vehicles of trans-historical memory, ceaselessly re-activated in the consciousness of their adherents’. Those engaged in missionary encounters frequently compared and judged their own actions on the basis of biblical precedent, drawing on the complex strands of both the Old and New Testaments to make sense of their own encounters.</p>\n<p>In constructing his own account, Peel worried about ‘how to simplify a complicated and many-stranded story without distorting its essential elements’ (Peel 2000, 44), ultimately arriving at a material metaphor:</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Colorful braided rope featuring intertwining red, blue, and green strands, creating a vibrant decorative pattern.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-8.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Three stranded cord</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Colorful braided rope featuring intertwining red, blue, and green strands, creating a vibrant decorative pattern.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-8.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Three stranded cord</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A multi-coloured wooden cord, with component fibres of different lengths – Yoruba, colonial, Christian, and other – that give it structure by pulling both together and against one another.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is striking that in setting out his vision of the history of human thought, Frazer (1911, 307-8) constructed a similar material metaphor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A web of three different threads – the black thread of magic, the red thread of religion, and the white thread of science, if under science we may include those simple truths drawn from the observation of nature…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Could we survey the web of thought from the beginning, we should probably perceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white… But carry your eye further along the fabric and you will remark that, while the black thread and white chequer still run through it, there rests on the middle portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply into its texture, a dark crimson stain…</em></p>\n<p>In constructing an artefactual history of the London Missionary Society, my ambition is similarly to construct a narrative out of multiple interlocking strands, coming in and out of conjunction with one another in different ways at different times.</p>\n<p>Textual models range from nineteenth century novels such as George Elliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em> and Herman Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em> to more recent works such as David Mitchell’s <em>Cloud Atlas,</em> or even Deleuze and Guattari’s <em>A Thousand Plateaus.</em> But in the deeper past we might consider the multi-stranded text of Herodotus’ <em>Histories</em>, or even the books of the Bible itself. In attempting to go beyond what Ann-Laura Stoler (2009) has called ‘familiar stories with predictable plots’, we have a range of textual artefacts to consider as models that do not conform to modernist monomyths – a significant example drawn from twentieth century anthropology would be Gregory Bateson’s (1936) <em>Naven</em>.</p>\n<p>I am not advocating a straightforwardly neo-Frazerian approach, but I do feel that it may be revealing to consider missionary encounters, as well as the way they have been narrated in light of the archetypical story of the priest-king at Nemi. Indeed, I am tempted to regard many of the artefacts collected and brought to Europe as essentially equivalent to Trobriand Kula valuables, but also to the Golden Fleece which Jason returned with to prove his right to rule.</p>\n<p>The widespread adoption of Christianity in large parts of the world over the past two centuries, including Africa and the Pacific in particular, is a transformation of world-historical significance that cannot be accounted for simply by the imposition of European power, or the cultural logic of capitalism – many missionaries were essentially powerless strangers, at least at the point they arrived.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Cover of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, traditional motifs, and a rural scene.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-9.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe - cover for first edition, published in 1958</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Cover of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, traditional motifs, and a rural scene.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-9.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe - cover for first edition, published in 1958</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>I take further inspiration from Chinua Achebe’s 1958 <em>Things Fall Apart</em> – an African response to Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> which recognises the tensions inherent in existing structures of power, and the forms of possibility that the arrival of outsiders missionaries presented for many people. The stranger missionaries did not become priest-kings entirely by their own efforts.</p>\n<p>If the functionalist anthropology of the Modernists concerned itself with how society maintains itself as a functioning system in a steady state or dynamic equilibrium, giving rise to a conception of culture as essentially inherited and determinative, then in a world structured around forms of managerialism intent on maintaining an unsustainable status quo, it has become increasingly urgent to find ways of writing about the mechanisms of societal transformation. How does society renew itself? How does newness enter the world (Bhabha 1994)?</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Peel, J.

Mary, his wife, bailed water continuously as others rowed them ashore.  Landing on the beach, John described what he saw as ‘the greatest concourse of people I had seen since we left England’.  It being a Sunday, worshippers were leaving their chapel, the women dressed in white bark cloth and bonnets, the men in clothes ‘of native manufacture’ and hats.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mary and John Williams had come to assist Charles and Elizabeth Pitman to establish their mission on the island. The Pitmans had crossed paths with George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman at New South Wales in 1825 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/10-two-of-the-tur-rursna/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a>), who directed them to Rarotonga. Tyerman and Bennet visited the island on their way to Sydney in June 1824, describing its chapel as ‘half finished’ and the people as ‘gentle, upright, and well behaved, attending with diligence to the means of grace, and daily making progess in the arts of civilised life’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Three days after the arrival of the Pitmans and the Williams, the ship on which they had arrived left because of the rough sea. The following day, the whole community of between two and three thousand people walked to another settlement on the eastern side of the island. Several Rarotongans, including Makea, the <em>ariki</em> (chief or king) at Avarua, offered to carry the many curious possessions brought by the recently arrived Europeans. On arrival at Ngatangiia, they discovered a pair of recently constructed houses, built for Papeiha and Tiberio, preachers from the Society Islands who had lived at Rarotonga for the previous four years. One of these houses was given up for the new arrivals. According to John Williams’ description, published a decade later, in 1837:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A day or two afterwards, they requested us to take our seat outside the door; and on doing so, we observed a large concourse of people coming towards us, bearing heavy burdens. They walked in procession, and dropped at our feet fourteen immense idols, the smallest of which was above five yards in length. Each of these was composed of a piece of <em>aito</em>, or iron-wood, about four inches in diameter, carved with rude imitations of the human head at one end, and with an obscene figure at the other, wrapped around with native cloth, until it became two or three yards in circumference. Near the wood were red feathers, and a string of small pieces of polished pearl shells, which were said to be the <em>manava</em>, or soul of the god. Some of these idols were torn to pieces before our eyes; others were reserved to decorate the rafters of the chapel we proposed to erect; and one was kept to be sent to England, which is now in the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Williams’ (1837) book, <em>A Narrative of Missionary Enterprises</em>, there is an image on the page after this description, showing what is described by a caption as ‘<em>One of the national idols’</em>, wrapped in layers of bark cloth, alongside its string of shells, or <em>manava,</em> captioned as the ’<em>Soul of the idol</em>’. Empty space on the page is filled by a sketch of ‘<em>The Fisherman’s god</em>’, also from Rarotonga. This ‘Fisherman’s god’, now in the British Museum (<a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/E_Oc-LMS-36\" target=\"_blank\">Oc,LMS.36</a>), appears to have been emasculated, though whether this happened in Rarotonga is unknown.</p>\n<p>Similarly, just as Williams did not describe the ‘obscene figure’ at the bottom of the ancestral pole, known in the Rarotonga language as <em>ki’iki’i</em>, the image in his book avoids showing the phallus with which the twelve foot long pole originally terminated. Whether this had also been removed is unclear.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In his text, however, Williams notes that:</p>\n<p><em>It is not, however, so respectable in appearance as when in its own country; for his Britannic Majesty’s officers, fearing lest the god should be made a vehicle for defrauding the king, very unceremoniously took it to pieces; and not being so well skilled in making gods as in protecting the revenue, they have not made it so handsome as when it was an object of veneration…</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Described as ‘A Gigantic Idol’ in the catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed around 1860, which provides this chapter’s title, it stood at the centre of the Missionary Museum for many decades (under the north skylight according to the catalogue), rivalling and ultimately eclipsing John Campbell’s South African Giraffe (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>). Images of the missionary museum suggest that unlike the image in Williams’ book, its bark cloth wrappings were wider at the bottom than the top, presumably a consequence of its disassembly by British custom officers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A few days after the performance of iconoclasm described by Williams, several thousand people assembled for Sunday worship. Half of them had to sit outside the building which served as their temporary chapel. Over the next two months, the entire community worked together to construct a new place to worship. According to Williams, it was ultimately:</p>\n<p><em>one hundred and fifty feet in length, and sixty wide; well plastered, and fitted up throughout with seats… It was a large, respectable, and substantial building; and the whole was completed without a single nail, or any iron-work whatever. It will accommodate nearly three thousand persons.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The script for this tale of conversion – the destruction of religious ‘idols’, the adoption of new forms of dress and the building of a new church, overseen from a distance by European missionaries, recapitulates the image produced for <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in July 1819, where it illustrated the conversion of Tahiti under Pomare II (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>). Given that no Europeans had lived at Rarotonga for any length of time before May 1827, it seems safe to assume that at least part of this script was compatible, or at least comprehensible, in terms of existing Polynesian religious practices.</p>\n<p>Nearly two centuries after the event that was depicted on the title page of John Williams’ (1837) <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises</em>, above a quotation from Isaiah ii, 18 declaring  ‘And the idols he shall utterly abolish’, how best can we understand the conditions that prompted this performance of conversion?</p>\n<p>John and Mary Williams had arrived in the Pacific ten years earlier, on 17 November 1817, together with four other missionary couples. Inspired by news of Pomare’s ‘overthrow of idolatry at Tahiti’ (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>), they formed part of a significant reinforcement for the, by then, fairly depleted first generation of European missionaries (four of whom had arrived in the <em>Duff</em> in 1797 and the other four in the <em>Royal Admiral</em>, a convict ship, in 1801).</p>\n<p>These additional recruits made it possible to expand European influence beyond the small island of Mo’orea, where British missionaries had stayed for much of the previous decade, sending despatches to London during Pomare’s reconquest of Tahiti including, in 1816, his ‘Idol Gods’ (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>).</p>\n<p>By 1817, the destruction of <em>marae</em> (religious ceremonial enclosures) and the burning of <em>to’o</em> (spiritual vessels) and <em>ti’i</em> (religious sculptures) had spread far beyond Papetoai on Mo’orea, where Pati’i, a priest, first burnt items he was responsible for in 1815. By the middle of the following year, requests for European teachers had arrived from the Leeward islands of Huahine, Ra’iatea, Taha’a and Borabora, where ‘idols’ had also been destroyed and churches constructed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Former students of the missionary school at Papetoai played a key role in taking new practices of reading and praying (converts were initially known as <em>Bure Atua</em> or prayers to God) to the Leeward Islands.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They were assisted by Tamatoa, ruler of Ra’iatea, one of Pomare’s key allies. By 1816, Tamatoa had overcome Fenuapeho, his rival on the neighbouring island of Taha’a, who attempted to defend the existing religious system.</p>\n<p>Since the capture of the <em>Duff</em> in 1799, however, European missionaries had been dependent on others if they wanted to travel by sea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In March 1817, the newly arrived mission printing press was transported, together with a number of missionaries, in the canoes of Vara, chief of Afareaitu in the east of Mo’orea.</p>\n<p>A start had been made on building a missionary ship, but it was the arrival of a mariner, Captain Nicholson, sent with the new missionaries from London, which prompted the completion of this vessel, a 70 ton brig. Its launch was arranged for 7 December 1817, but when Pomare II threw a bottle of red wine and declared <em>Ia ora na oe e Haweis</em> (Prosperity to you, O Haweis), naming the ship after his principal benefactor in Britain, the smashing glass so alarmed those holding her ropes that they let go, and the Haweis toppled onto her side. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Righted, she was subsequently launched.</p>\n<p>Missionaries were taken to re-establish stations on the main island of Tahiti at Papara, Papaoa and Puna’auia in Atehuru (called Burder’s Point by the missionaries, after the Secretary of the Society in London), as well as at Matavai, the original location of the mission (Chapter 1), abandoned since 1809. In mid-1818, the Haweis transported Ellis, Williams and Threlkeld to Huahine in the Leeward Islands, together with their wives and a printing press.</p>\n<p>In September of that year, Williams and Threlkeld persuaded the <em>Active,</em> purchased by Samuel Marsden in 1814 to supply his Church Missionary Society mission at New Zealand, to take them to Ra’iatea together with Tamatoa. Having received numerous requests for books from Paumonaa and Tifai, former pupils at the missionary school at Papetoai, they went to provide support and oversight.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Under Williams and Threlkeld, as well as for John Orsmond until he left for Bora Bora in 1820, Ra’iatea became an alternative (and rival) centre of missionary operations. All three were zealous missionary recruits of the new generation, suspicious of the compromises arrived at by the older Tahitian missionaries. In a letter written to the Directors in July 1822, following the death of Pomare II, Williams and Threlkeld declared:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not one native in this Island (Ra’iatea), whose conduct is at all consistent with the Gospel, laments his loss, but rather consider it interposition of God in removing him, in short his whole aim was to grasp at all of the Islands under the pretence of Christianising them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Orsmond, in a somewhat embittered letter sent to England after he was dismissed from the LMS in 1849, described Pomare as ‘a beastly sot’:</p>\n<p><em>The King changed his Gods, but he had no other reason but that of consolidating his Government. After his conquest it is true he went by short stages to shew his authority, receive presents from his newly acquired subjects, drink the abundance of native spirits, and then in their inebriety, cast down their Marae and destroy their Gods, thus by strategem taking away from any future rebellion thro the power of the idols which were always leaders in war.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The early years at Ra’iatea were spent building houses, chapels and bridges, including some on the neighbouring island of Taha’a.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams’ appeal to supporters in Birmingham prompted a donation to assist his work, including:</p>\n<p><em>two Casks, one containing Nails only, the other, Nails, Hammers, Bench Vices, Nippers, Pincers, Saws, Printing Ink and various other Articles.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In May 1819, an auxiliary Missionary Society was established with Tamatoa as president.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Puna, one of these who spoke at the meeting described the Missionary Society as like the wind:</p>\n<p><em>that makes the heavy ships sail… If there had been none, no ship would have come here with Missionaries. If there is no property, how can Missionaries be sent to other countries, how can the ships sail? Let us then give what we can.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tuahine, added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whence comes the great waters? Is it not from the small streams that flow into them… I have been thinking that the Missionary Society in Britain is like the great water, and that such little Societies as ours are like the little streams. Let there be many little streams: let not ours be dry. Let missionaries be sent to every land. We are far better off now than we used to be. We do not now sleep with our cartridges under our heads, our guns by our sides, and our hearts in fear…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tuahine’s comments capture a sense that the adoption of Christianity was associated with an end to hostilities and the establishment of peace, but this entailed accepting the authority of the leaders who embraced the new religion such as Pomare II at Tahiti and Tamatoa at Ra’iatea.</p>\n<p>In March 1821, a canoe arrived at Ra’iatea from Rurutu in the Austral Islands, 560 kilometres to the South, where disease had recently decimated the population. Au’ura, leader of the group, was deeply interested by Christian practices, learning to read during the time he spent at Ra’iatea. Four months later, the arrival of a ship, the <em>Hope</em>, tested the Ra’iateans’ commitment to supporting missionary activity by providing an opportunity for the 30 people who had come from Rurutu to return. Au’ura, however, stated that he didn’t wish to return to his ‘land of darkness without a light in his hand’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Puna and Mahamene volunteered to go with him, together with their wives, supported by the congregation at Ra’iatea. Along with bark cloth, food, spelling books and gospels, they were given ‘various useful tools’ including razors, knives and scissors. Lancelot Threlkeld arranged for his personal boat to be towed by the <em>Hope,</em> so that it could return with news. He also wrote to London stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Chief [Au’ura] promises their Gods to you we reccommend [sic] him not to burn them but send them prisoners to the Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a letter also sent in the <em>Hope</em> to the Directors, Tamatoa explained that he had covered up his own ‘evil spirits’ with the intention of sending them to London, but when he fell ill:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>some men said to me that I had taken care of the evil spirits, and that was the reason I was overtaken with sickness; I was requested by the people to burn the evil spirits, and I said Burn them, <em>Oro e a Hiro</em> were the two evil spirits that were burned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In August 1821, Threlkeld’s boat arrived back at Ra’iatea with letters from Au’ura, Puna and Mahamene, carrying what John Williams described as ’prisoners, the gods of the heathen, taken in this bloodless war, and won by the blood of Him who is Prince of Peace’. A letter sent by Puna and Mahamene described a meeting of ‘the chiefs and king’ at Rurutu when Au’ura proposed that ’the evil spirit be this instant cast into the fire’, suggesting that God had guided him to Ra’iatea ‘where the teachers are’. According to this letter, two men started up ‘inspired by the evil spirit’, stating ‘I have seen the foundation of the firmament, up in the sky. Taaroa brought me forth.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Auura then answered the evil spirit thus, ‘Do you leap up then, that we may see you flying up into the sky. Do so now, immediately. Truly thou art even the very foundation of deceit. The people of Rurutu have been completely destroyed through you, and through you alone, and now you shall not deceive us again…'.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Puna then advised the assembled men:</p>\n<p><em>prepare one place where you may all eat together, you and your wives and children, and your king, at one eating place, and there the evil spirit who has just now inspired that man shall be completely ashamed: he has no refuge; but cast away every disgraceful thing from among you, for that is the reason he remains among you.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When communal eating prompted no apparent ill effects, the people of Rurutu ‘boldly seized the gods, and then proceeded to demolish totally the Morais [Maraes], which was all completely effected that day.’ Puna and Mahamene then oversaw the construction of a chapel, in which Tyerman and Bennet noticed old spears being used ’to support the balustrade of the pulpit staircase’ in November 1822.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The evening that Threlkeld’s boat arrived back at Ra’iatea, a meeting was held in the chapel, lit by a great many cocoa nut shell lamps. The evangelists’ accounts from Rurutu were shared and the ‘idols’ exhibited from the pulpit. According to Williams:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One in particular, Aa, the national god of Rurutu, excited considerable interest; for, in addition to his being bedecked with little gods outside, a door was discovered at his back; on opening which, he was found to be full of small gods; and no less than twenty-four were taken out, one after another, and exhibited to public view. He is said to to be the ancestor by whom their island was peopled, and who after death was deified.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tuahine, one of the deacons at the church remarked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus the gods made with hands shall perish. There they are, tied with cords! Yes! their very names also are changed! Formerly they were called ’<em>Te mau Atua,’</em> or the gods; now they are called ’<em>Te mau Varu ino,’</em> or evil spirits: Their glory, look! It is bird’s feathers, soon rotten; but our God is the same for ever.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another speaker observed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at the chandeliers! Oro never taught us any thing like this! Look at our wives, in their gowns and their bonnets, and compare ourselves with the poor natives of Rurutu, when they were drifted to our island, and mark the superiority! And by what means have we obtained it? By our own invention and goodness? No! It is to the good name of Jesus we are indebted. Then let us send this name to other lands, that others may enjoy the same benefits.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Religion clearly remained a material business for many members of the congregation at Ra’iatea. The wrapping of Christian women in gowns and bonnets could be read as advancement, just as the unwrapping and burning of ‘gods made with the hands’ marked a devaluation. Nevertheless, it is significant that the translated remarks of both Tamatoa and Tuahine refer primarily to ‘spirits’ rather than to ‘idols’, a Biblical term used mostly by European missionaries.</p>\n<p>{Figure “fig-c12-11”}<br>\n<a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uue7tp4t\" target=\"_blank\">‘Idols’ worshipped by the Inhabitants of the South Sea Islands</a></p>\n<p>Printed to face the title page of Volume 2 of William Ellis (1829) _Polynesian Researches (_London: Fisher, Son &amp; Jackson). <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uue7tp4t\" target=\"_blank\">Wellcome Collection EPB/B/21643/1.v2</a></p>\n<p>Earlier religious practices involving <em>marae, to’o</em> and <em>ti’i</em> appear to have provided the means to manifest and communicate with immaterial spiritual entities – just as printed Bibles embodied the immaterial word of God, and newly built Chapels housed congregations through which the Holy Spirit could act on earth. Describing <em>ti’i</em> (carvings representing spirits) and <em>to’o</em> (pieces of hard wood representing national or family gods), following conversations with a maker of such things at Ra’iatea, William Ellis suggested that:</p>\n<p><em>Into these they supposed the god entered at certain seasons, or in answer to the prayers of the priests. During this indwelling of the the gods, they imagined even the images were very powerful: but when the spirit had departed, though they were among the most sacred things, their extraordinary powers were gone.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Early nineteenth century Evangelical Christianity, with its emphasis on opening oneself to and accepting, the redeeming power of divine Grace must have been immediately comprehensible to people whose existing religious practices also concerned the channeling divine power in the world, even if they called this <em>mana</em> rather than Grace. This sense of recognition appears to have been mutual, William Ellis declaring:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it is impossible not to feel interested in a people who were accustomed to consider themselves surrounded by invisible intelligences, and who recognised in the rising sun – the mild and silver moon – the shooting star – the meteor’s transient flame – the ocean’s roar – the tempest’s blast, or the evening breeze – the movements of mighty spirits.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In October 1821, John and Mary Williams traveled to New South Wales in the <em>Westmoreland</em>, a visiting ship, for health reasons.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Inspired by what had recently taken place at Rurutu, Williams proposed taking further members of his congregation to serve as missionaries at Aitutaki, in what is now the Cook Islands. Members of the Church selected two of their number, Papeiha and Vahapata, for this work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At Aitutaki, ‘the Chief’, also called Tamatoa, joined them on deck. When told about the conversion of Tahiti and the Society Islands, he asked about the fate of ‘great <em>Tangaroa’,</em> as well as ‘Koro of Raiatea’ [presumably Oro] and was told that both had been burned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He agreed that Papeiha and Vahapata could remain on the island, and it was in the course of this conversation that Williams learned that Rarotonga, of which he had heard much in Ra’iatea, was relatively close at hand.</p>\n<p>Williams, who had recently inherited property from his late mother, purchased a vessel at Sydney, the <em>Endeavour</em>, intended to trade tobacco and sugar with the colony on behalf of Tamatoa and other leaders in the islands.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams recruited John Dibbs, second officer of the <em>Westmoreland</em>, to command this ship, which he also planned to use to deliver missionaries to surrounding islands.</p>\n<p>Williams returned to Ra’iatea stocked with shoes, stockings, tea-kettles, tea-cups and saucers, as well as tea, hoping that by encouraging tea consumption he could persuade the islanders to grow more sugar. Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales also gave cows, calves and sheep to the chiefs and missionaries, as well as two ensigns (British maritime flags) and a pair of church bells.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In April 1822, while still at Sydney, Williams received letters from Papeiha and Vahapata at Aitutaki, telling him that a number of people originally from Rarotonga had embraced their teachings, and wished to return to their own island. Stopping at Rurutu in May, on the way back to Ra’iatea, Williams found a chapel filled with people wearing bonnets and hats, many of whom had learned to read, as well as plastered houses for the teachers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In mid-1823, following the return of the <em>Endeavour</em> from her first trading voyage to Sydney, Williams sailed to Aitutaki with Robert Bourne, as well as four couples from the congregation at Ra’iatea who had volunteered as missionaries, and one from Taha’a.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They intended to find Rarotonga, but also to leave teachers at other nearby islands. On board the <em>Endeavour,</em> Williams created a letter of instruction for the Polynesian missionaries. The advice it contains suggests he recognised that there was a fine balance to be struck between encouraging the overthrow of existing practices and communicating the good news of Christian salvation, alongside the advantages of new technical skills:</p>\n<p><em>Remember that this work is the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not to prosper by the strength of man. The Holy Spirit must do the work. Without him, it will not grow…</em></p>\n<p><em>Do not let the whole of your discourses be directed against the evil spirit; but exalt our Lord Jesus Christ and his Gospel. Tell fully of his great compassion to us, and of the efficacy of his blood to cleanse and save the soul…</em></p>\n<p><em>All their lesser evil customs, such as going naked, cutting and scratching themselves in seasons of grief, tattooing their bodies, eating raw fish, &amp;c. you will endeavour to cast down; but the greater evils will require your first efforts, and then the smaller…</em></p>\n<p><em>Have good houses yourselves, and all the little concerns within them, let them be good also… Teach them all you know – to build houses, to do carpentering work, to plaster, and to make bedsteads and seats, to make oil and arrow-root… Your wives also, let them teach the women to sew, to make bonnets, mats, cloth, &amp;c., that they may appear decent…</em></p>\n<p><em>If you obtain idols, burn some (but not the best) before their face, lest in case of sickness or other evil, they should think that the gods still in existence inflicted it. The remainder send to Raiatea as a rejoicing to us, and we will send them to England as a rejoicing to them.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the <em>Endeavour</em> arrived at Aitutaki on 9 July 1823, canoes approached demonstrating their peaceful intentions by holding up spelling books and European-style hats. Coming ashore, Williams found the <em>maraes</em> had been destroyed and a large plastered chapel (200 foot long) built, together with a five bedroom house for Papeiha and Vahapata.</p>\n<p>Encountering a pair of ‘grim-looking gods’ being used as pillars to support a cooking house, he offered a pair of fish-hooks in exchange. Their owner, according to Williams ‘propped up the house, took out the idols, and threw them down; and while they were prostrate on the ground, he gave them a kick, saying, “There – your reign is at an end”.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Williams delivered a sermon in the chapel, Papeiha and Vahapata before the pulpit, dressed in European clothes and facing the congregation. Afterwards, according to Williams, The gods and bundles of gods, which had escaped destruction, 31 in number, were carried in triumph to the ship’s boat; and we came off to the vessel with the trophies of our bloodless conquest’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sailing in search of Rarotonga, Papeiha updated Williams on events at Aitutaki over the previous eighteen months, including three periods of armed conflict (suggesting Christian conquest was not as bloodless as claimed). Papeiha and Vahapata had initially been regarded as ‘Two logs of drift-wood, washed on shore by the waves of the ocean’, but their status was enhanced by the arrival of the <em>Endeavour</em> on her way to New South Wales in December 1822, bringing spelling books, axes, pigs and goats from Ra’iatea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Soon afterwards, Papeiha called for the destruction of the island’s <em>maraes</em>, the presentation of ‘idols’ to him, and the construction of a chapel. Gleaming white, with plaster made from roasted coral, the new chapel must have dazzled those who had never before seen such a building.</p>\n<p>After a week of searching unsuccessfully for Rarotonga, the <em>Endeavour</em> steered for the island of Mangaia. Swimming ashore, Papeiha explained the nature of the ship and its mission. On landing, however, the teachers and their property were seized – a saw broken into three, bonnets dragged through the water, bedsteads seized, and cocoa-nut oil poured over people’s bodies. The teachers’ wives were carried into the woods, only to be rescued when the ship fired a small cannon.</p>\n<p>Papeiha, who had been strangled during the attack with a tiputa (a poncho type upper garment made of bark cloth, worn by many converts), told the leader who had encouraged them to land what he thought of this behaviour. The man in question, we are told, wept, declaring that all heads were an equal height on his island.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Months later, the <em>Endeavour</em> returned to Mangaia on its way to New South Wales with Tyerman and Bennet, leaving Davida and Tiere, both unmarried men from Taha’a, as missionaries on the island, which had suffered a severe epidemic following this earlier visit.</p>\n<p>After Mangaia, the <em>Endeavour</em> went to Atiu, where John Orsmond had sent a pair of missionaries from Bora Bora a few months previously. They hadn’t made much progress, but when Rongo-ma-Tane, a leader on the island, visited the ship he was told about events at Aitutaki and shown the once powerful ‘idols’ lying in the hold. Attending a service on deck, he determined to bring about the same changes on his island, asking to purchase an axe with which he could cut posts to build ‘God’s house’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Persuading Rongo-ma-Tane to stay on board, they sailed to Mitiaro and Mauke, where teachers were landed and instructions given for <em>maraes</em> and ‘evil spirits’ to be destroyed. Williams could not help but see the hand of God in the immediate conversion of these islands. Rongo-ma-tane then directed the <em>Endeavour</em> towards Rarotonga, returning to Atiu with his requested axes, and ‘other useful articles’.</p>\n<p>After struggling with contrary winds for several days, the <em>Endeavour</em> was about to return to Ra’iatea when land was sighted from the top of the mast. Papeiha, Vahineino and one of the Rarotongans from Aitutaki went ashore, where it was agreed that teachers should land. Makea, who Williams described as ‘the King’ – ‘about six feet high, and very stout; of noble appearance, and of a truly commanding aspect’ – came aboard the ship. Among the four Rarotonga women and two men who were returning from Aitutaki, he met Tapairu, a close relative.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Two teachers and their wives spent the night ashore with Papeiha, but returned to the ship early the next morning. Williams was told that a rival chief (possibly Pa Te Pou, <em>ariki</em> of Takitumu) had tried to take one of the female teachers as his wife, but that Tapairu defended the women. Williams was reluctant to abandon the intended teachers to their fate, but Papeiha volunteered to remain at Rarotonga alone if his friend Tiberio was sent to join him. Papeiha waved goodbye to Williams, going ashore in a canoe with just the clothes on his back, his Bible and some spelling books.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Arriving back at Ra’iatea, ‘as other warriors feel a pride in displaying trophies of the victories they win’, Williams triumphantly hung his ‘prisoners’, ‘the rejected idols of Aitutaki’ from the yard-arms of the <em>Endeavour</em> as they entered the harbour in triumph.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Once again, the coconut oil chandeliers were lit, and the ‘idols were suspended about the chapel’. 25 were then sent to Tyerman and Bennet, then still at Tahiti and six others directly to the Missionary Museum in England.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams made another trip in the <em>Endeavour,</em> to Rurutu and Rimatara, but this would be his last. Traders at Sydney had persuaded the Governor of New South Wales to apply a duty to sugar cane and tobacco imports, rendering the ship an unprofitable and unsustainable enterprise. In addition, the Directors in London disapproved of Williams involving himself in financial speculation, so the <em>Endeavour</em> was sent to Sydney to be sold. Williams provided the Directors’ with his interpretation of events:</p>\n<p><em>Satan knows well that this ship was the most fatal weapon ever formed against his interests in the great South Sea; and, therefore, as soon as he felt the effects of its first blow, he has wrested it out of our hands.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Appealing for funds for a replacement, Williams and Threlkeld wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think not of the expense of such a vessel. Remember the gods are to be her cargo, and your reward. Twice has the Lord God sent you these from hence and from other islands, and your eyes shall see yet greater things.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When Williams returned to Rarotonga in May 1827, it had been less than four years since his first visit. When Tyerman and Bennet, together with Threlkeld, visited the island on their way to to New South Wales in late 1824 they reported that the whole population were already engaged in building a six hundred foot long chapel.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> How had Papeiha reorganised the island along Christian principles in such a short period?</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Sissons, who has closely examined the establishment of Christianity in Rarotonga, as part of the wider contemporary phenomenon he calls <em>The Polynesian Iconoclasm,</em> has suggested that apparent conversion was ‘as much a material process of indigenisation as it was a local appropriation of foreign ideas’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> What does he mean? His reconstruction of events is approximately as follows.</p>\n<p>Rarotonga was, and remains, organised into three main districts (<em>vaka,</em> literally canoes, perhaps referencing the arrival of ancestors generations previously): Te Au o Tonga, Puaikura and Takitumu, each overseen by an <em>ariki</em> (high chief or ‘king’). In the decade before Papeiha’s arrival, conflict between the three <em>vaka</em> resulted in the dominance of the Takitumu district. In late July 1823, however, Papeiha arrived at Avarua in the Te Au o Tonga district where Makea was <em>ariki</em>.</p>\n<p>By November, Papeiha had assembled a group of high status students, much like the early students at Papetoai, including Makea’s eldest son. After Tiberio arrived in December, the two evangelists toured the island, meeting the leaders of the other districts. When they returned to Avarua, a priest brought his son to be taught, offering to destroy a wooden ‘idol’ in return. Papeiha unwrapped and cut up the image before burning it, roasting and eating bananas in the embers. Within ten days fourteen further ‘idols’ had been destroyed, or at least dethroned. Soon afterwards Tinomana, <em>ariki of</em> Arorangi in Puaikura district, the other defeated region, sanctioned the destruction of his <em>marae.</em></p>\n<p>In March 1824, Pa Te Pou, <em>ariki</em> in the dominant Takitumu region, summoned Papeiha and Tiberio to Ngatangiia to also burn his ‘idols’. Soon afterwards, a feast was held at Avarua in Makea’s district which included a prayer meeting at which <em>ariki</em> and regional chiefs, <em>mata’iapo,</em> wore hats made from bark cloth taken from destroyed ‘idols’. It seems that the three <em>ariki</em> united to form a single large settlement at Avarua, providing feasts that accompanied the construction the large chapel, visited by Tyerman and Bennet in June 1824. The people of the dominant Takitumu district worked on one side of the building, while those of the defeated Te Au O Tonga and Puaikura districts worked on the other. According to John Williams, who visited the chapel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This, from the circumstances of its erection, was rather an interesting building, but it was destitute of elegance; for, although plastered and floored, and looking exceedingly well at a distance, the workmanship was rough, and the doors were formed of planks lashed together with cnet, which also supplied the place of hinges. One of its most striking peculiarities was the presence of many indelicate heathen figures carved on the centre posts. This was accounted for from the circumstances, that, when built, a considerable part of the people were heathens; and as a portion of the work was allotted to each district unaccompanied by specific directions as to the precise manner of its performance, the builders thought that the figure with which they decorated their maraes would be equally ornamental in the main pillars of a Christian sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When Robert Bourne visited in October 1825 the chapel had recently been plastered, and he was shown ’the cumbrous deities, fourteen in number… now lying like Dagon of old before the ark’. Dagon was an ancient Syrian God, and according to 1 Samuel 5 in the Old Testament, after the Philistines placed the captured ark of the covenant in Dagon’s temple, they returned the next morning the found Dagon fallen face downwards on the group. When Dagon was raised up, he was found the next day fallen again, with both his head and two hands cut off on the threshold of the temple.</p>\n<p>Despite such Old Testament precedent, Bourne recognised that a third of Rarotonga’s population still did not support this religious transformation, having pledged allegiance to district chiefs and priests in opposition to the three <em>ariki</em>. Papeiha and Tiberio (armed with a gun) even led an attack on one of the rebel settlements, capturing further ancestral poles by force.</p>\n<p>When the population of Avarua decamped to Ngatangiia, following the arrival of Williams and Pitman in May 1827, it was to begin the construction of another chapel in that region. The chapel’s rafters were wrapped in bark cloth taken from the <em>ki’iki’i</em> which had been torn apart, and some of the ancestral poles were themselves hung from its rafters. After this had been completed, a replacement chapel was built at Avarua (1828) and a third at Arorangi (1830). In a statement of unity, the three chapels were linked by a new coastal road, the <em>ara Tapu</em> (sacred path), which replaced the <em>ara metua</em> (ancient path) which had connected the district <em>marae</em>, along which annual processions were typically made.</p>\n<p>Just as at Tahiti and Ra’iatea, the adoption of Christianity at Rarotonga was associated with a consolidation and centralisation of chiefly power, materialised in the construction of new churches. These powerfully demonstrated the capacity of <em>ariki</em> to demand and coordinate the labour and resources of others. Resistance continued at Rarotonga, however, and in mid 1828 the church in the Takitumu district was burned down by rebels. Others attempted to burn the church and school-houses at Avarua, defiling the seats of the chiefs and missionaries in the chapel, as well as the pulpit. Only after an epidemic in mid 1830 did violence end. Even in 1831, Charles Pitman could write in his journal that:</p>\n<p><em>The desire of nearly all the people of the island is for their old practices being revived… should the Chiefs again turn their backs to the Teachers the people would for the greater part by far return with them with joy to their heathenish practices.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This chapter began with the image on the title page of John Williams’ book, showing the presentation and destruction of ‘idols’ in front of the teachers’ houses at Ngatangiia. It ends by considering this image as readers would have encounetred it in early editions of the book, alongside a colour image produced by George Baxter with the title ‘<em>Te Po, a Chief of Rarotonga’</em> (Te Pou Ariki of Takitumu).</p>\n<p>The image is magnificent, showing  the <em>ariki</em> with his spear aloft, holding a fan in the other hand. His noble body is wrapped with tattoos and gleaming white barkcloth, his head adorned by a headdress suggestive of a crown. His centrality within the image seems to demonstrate mastery over both land and sea. In the background, however, a lightly sketched European ship (not evident in the painting, above, on which this seems to have been based) is suggestive of new arrivals.</p>\n<p>Viewed in combination with the image on the title page, which would have faced it when opening the book, the images present a contrast. They are images of before and after, suggestive of conversion, evoking images of imaginary tattooed British ancestors before the coming of Christianity. While the conversion of Rarotonga involved transformations in dress, as well as the replacement of one type of religious structure, the <em>marae</em> with another, the <em>chapel</em>, these outward changes likely mask many continuities in the attitudes of the majority of the population.</p>\n<p>One undeniable change, however, seems to have been the destruction and removal of wood carvings that evoked ancestral power. The ‘gigantic idol’ at the Missionary Museum (now in the British Museum) appears to have been the only <em>ki’iki’i</em> of its size to survive. In 1853, Isaia Papehia, the 15 year old son of Papeiha, whose maternal grandfather was <em>ariki</em> of Tinomana, travelled to London with the Rev. William Gill, who had been a missionary on Rarotonga since 1839.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Visiting the Missionary Museum in London, Isaia encountered the ‘idol of his own grandfather of which he had heard much; the sight of it affected him to tears, and he expressed deep compassion for the people of his native land’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to Rev. Gordon, who returned to Polynesia with him in 1856 in the missionary ship <em>John Williams</em> (Chapter 15), Isaia told the missionary meetings he attended at Sydney and Melbourne that:</p>\n<p><em>He is a great big fellow and when I saw him I was greatly astonished and climbed up and broke off a piece of his nose to take to Rarotonga, and I asked Dr Tidman [Secretary of the LMS] to let me take him back to Rarotonga, to show the young people the queer thing their fathers worshipped, but he say, ’No let you do that.’</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I have been incredibly lucky to have worked closely over the years with a number of colleagues with Pacific specialisms over the years, from whom I have learned an enormous amount: Steven Hooper, Karen Jacobs, Nicholas Thomas, Julie Adams, Maia Nuku and Alice Christophe, among others. Nevertheless, as an interloper in the region, any errors or faults are entirely my own.</p>\n<p>Recently, I have been grateful for encouragement from Rod Dixon, Jean Mason and Jeffrey Sissons in setting up a collaborative PhD project with the British Museum to further unpack this extraordinary process of conversion and collection through the surviving collections. I am looking forward to their feedback on this chaper, as well as that of Mililani Ganivet, who we appointed to the studentship in 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Williams, J.

These would, he proposed, be useful ‘in conveying a more lively impression of the actual degradation of the heathen and the polluting character of idol worship; and also of shewing what Missionaries had been able to effect in promoting the knowledge of the True God and the Only Saviour’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis referred Leipoldt to the list at the end of his letter, itemising ‘the accompanying specimens’, as well as books ‘prepared by our Missionaries in different parts of the World’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With items from the Pacific, South Asia, China and southern Africa, the list covers the main areas in which the LMS had been most active over the previous 35 years. Half the ‘specimens’ appear to have been religious ‘idols’, from Tahiti, the Cook Islands, Myanmar, India and possibly China, with a similar number of seemingly everyday items from Africa – a ladle, a knife, a necklace and two rings.</p>\n<p>While not obviously demonstrating ‘the degradation of the heathen’, these would have been of considerable interest in Barmen, since the Rhenish Missionary Society sent its first four recruits to South Africa under the guidance of John Philip, the Scottish superintendent of LMS missions there. Philip had travelled to London in 1826 to lobby for the rights of indigenous people at the Cape (more on this below), returning to South Africa in 1829 with recruits from the LMS, the Rhenish Missionary Society, as well as the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (a Protestant organisation established in 1822).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>There follows a listing of religious and missionary translations, tracts and other texts such as grammars, spelling books and memoirs. The way their descriptions are laid out, however, asserts a categorical distinction between printed texts and the ‘specimens’ listed separately above, including a catechism from Madras, handwritten on leaves.</p>\n<p>The numbering of these twinned lists suggests that 12 printed books were sent to Barmen but only eleven ‘specimens’, including the palm leaf catechism. At the bottom of the page, however, a single line adds ‘All wrapped up in a Piece of Tahitian Cloth’, suggesting there were equal numbers of printed books and other artefacts, if we count the Tahitian cloth as a ‘specimen’ in its own right.</p>\n<p>Why Ellis chose to wrap the other items in Tahitian barkcloth is unclear, but he certainly knew that tapa was used for wrapping valuable items in Polynesia, such as the recently arrived ancestral pole from Rarotonga (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>).</p>\n<p>In <em>Polynesian Researches,</em> published three years earlier, Ellis noted that images of gods were generally ‘clothed’ with native cloth, but also that that when he gave copies of the newly printed Gospel of Luke to five men from Tahiti, ‘each wrapped his book up in a piece of white native cloth’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Barkcloth was used to wrap the bodies of the deceased, but was increasingly also used to cover the bodies of living Christian converts, especially women. Can we regard Ellis’ decision to wrap these items in Tahitian cloth as an indicator of their value, or does it simply indicate the ready availability of such cloth at his office in London?</p>\n<p>The letter from Ellis to Leipoldt, together with the artefacts which accompanied it, illustrates not only the existence of cooperative relationships between Protestant missionary societies in different parts of northern Europe (the LMS had also worked closely with the Netherlands Missionary Society since the late eighteenth century, as well as sending a number of earlier Berlin-trained German-speaking missionaries to South Africa – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>), but importantly also the way in which the circulation and display of artefacts contributed to these.</p>\n<p>While the division of this list, between handmade ‘specimens’ and printed ‘books’, is suggestive of Webb Keane’s semiotic ideologies and the Protestant prioritisation of printed vernacular texts,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> I’d like to suggest that the inclusion of equal numbers of ‘specimens’, ‘all wrapped up in a piece of Tahitian cloth’, tells us something important about the development of what I would like to call the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex.</p>\n<p>The Exhibitionary Complex is a phrase originally coined by Tony Bennett in a well-known journal paper, published in Spring 1988.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Grappling with the implications of Michel Foucault’s work on the reforming institutions of the ‘carcerial archipelago’: the prison, the asylum, and the clinic. Bennet took up Foucault’s archaeological and genealogical projects in relation to <em>the Birth of the Museum</em>, suggesting that public museums should be considered in relation to other forms of display, such as international expositions, arcades and department stores, as well as other contemporary technologies of vision.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bennett ultimately argued that museums were institutions, ‘not of confinement but of exhibition, forming a complex of disciplinary and power relations whose development might more fruitfully be juxtaposed to, rather than aligned with, the formation of Foucault’s ‘carcerial archipelago’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He suggested that reforming institutions of incarceration saw the bodies of the condemned, previously a focus for very public periodic displays of power on the scaffold, increasingly subjected to surveillance and regulation. By contrast, he argued the ‘exhibitionary complex’ transferred objects and bodies:</p>\n<p><em>from the enclosed and private domains in which they had previously been displayed (but to a restricted public) into progressively more open and public arenas where, through the representations to which they were subjected, they formed vehicles for inscribing and broadcasting the messages of power (but of a different type) throughout society.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In pushing back against the idea that museums could be considered institutions of confinement, Bennet suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems to imply that works of art had previously wandered through the streets of Europe like the Ships of Fools in Foucault’s <em>Madness and Civilisation;</em> or that geological and natural history specimens had been displayed before the world, like the condemned on the scaffold, rather than being withheld from public gaze, secreted in the <em>studiolo</em> of princes, or made accessible only to the limited gaze of high society in the <em>cabinets des curious</em> of the aristocracy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The terms of Bennet’s objection to considering museums as part of a ‘carcerial archipelago’ are significant – his focus on ‘the streets of Europe’ and the ‘<em>studiolo</em> of princes’ locates the Exhibitionary Complex in relation to an almost exclusively European genealogy. Arguably it also positions this in Europe’s South, seemingly insulated from the most significant impacts of the Protestant Reformation.</p>\n<p>However, works of art had once moved through the streets of Europe, as part of spectacular processions of religious images (they still do in parts of southern Europe), but during the Reformation and counter-Reformation were increasingly confined within institutions (when they survived iconoclastic purges). We can arguably hear the echoes of these earlier image wars in recent calls to remove the statues of slave-owners and colonialists from our streets, in order to confine them safely within our museums.</p>\n<p>This suggests we might consider the development of the Exhibitionary Complex beyond the immediate frame provided by the French Revolution of 1789, and the conversion of the Louvre into a museum of confiscated royal and church paintings in 1793. Indeed, it seems important in setting the scene for Foucault’s ‘modern episteme’ to account for the revolutionary dimensions of Britain’s seventeenth century, as well as the Protestant substrate which operated in France long after the revocation of Edict of Nantes in 1685.</p>\n<p>Foucault suggested that what he called governmentality, the practices of power deployed by the modern state, were ultimately rooted in the individualising pastoral practices of the Christian Church.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Commenting on Weber’s linking of the Protestant ethic to the spirit of capitalism, the Dutch Philosopher Antoon Braeckman has recently argued that ‘the Protestant form of life has also proved to be the soil in which the governmental power of the modern state first took root.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, he suggested that the process by which:</p>\n<p><em>many governmental initiatives that had arisen in the Protestant church communities were transferred to secular governments… provides a potentially fruitful path for further shaping Foucault’s unfinished genealogy of the modern state.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Can we regard the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex as an ‘unwritten chapter’ or ‘missing link’ in Foucault’s Genealogy of the Modern State, allowing us to chart a series of peculiarly Protestant developments in governmentality?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Can it be regarded as part of the complex of pastoral techniques which ‘have nestled, multiplied, and spread with the laicised framework of the state apparatus’, according to Foucault?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bennet suggested that the Exhibitionary Complex was ‘a set of cultural technologies concerned to organise a voluntarily self-regulating citizenry’, as part of the ‘the ethical and educative function of the modern state’, ultimately feeding into the ‘development of the bourgeois democratic polity’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By necessity not simply a European project, the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex provides an alternative vantage point from which to consider a range of globally-connected practices of confinement and display.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I intend to suggest that the dual dimensions of confinement and display form part of most carcerial institutions. While their precise configuration shifts in the movement from the scaffold to the prison, or the religious carnival to the art gallery (in part by moving indoors and becoming more permanent – a process of enclosure), power nevertheless continues to operate in spectacular ways.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nineteenth century prisons, hospitals and asylums often formed highly visible architectural statements within urban spaces, and many maintained public visiting hours no more or less restrictive than those of most nineteenth century museums. This suggests the ‘carcerial archipelago’ and the ‘exhibitionary complex’ are far more aligned than Bennet suggested.</p>\n<p>Foucault’s clearest statement in relation to museums seems to come in an essay, <em>Of Other Spaces,</em> originally published in October 1984, shortly after he died. It begins:</p>\n<p><em>The great obsession of the nineteenth century was, as we know, history: with its themes of development and of suspension, of crisis and cycle, themes of the ever-accumulating past, with its great preponderence of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This he contrasted with a twentieth century focus on space, characterised as the ‘epoch of simultaneity’, suggesting that many contemporary polemics ‘oppose the pious descendants of time and the determined inhabitants of space’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The focus for Foucault’s piece of fairly oracular writing, however, is the socially constituted other places that he calls heterotopias, defined as ‘counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> These had their origins, he suggests, in ‘crisis heterotopias’, temporarily constituted sacred or privileged places, the liminal zones constituted by what Arnold Van Gennep called <em>Rites de Passage.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Foucault suggests these were gradually replaced by what he calls ‘heterotopias of deviation’, the institutions of his carcerial archipelago. He explores the ways in which existing heterotopias have been repurposed, using the example of the cemetery, which until the end of the eighteenth century was often situated at the heart of European cities. From the nineteenth century, however, these were increasingly relocated to their edges, where, according to Foucault ‘everyone has a right to her or his own little box for her or his own little personal decay’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The museum, like the library, according to Foucault, is a heterotopia ‘in which time never stops building up and topping its own summit’:</p>\n<p><em>…the idea of accumulating everything, or establishing a sort of general archive, the will to enclose in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, all tastes, the idea of constituting a place of all times that is itself outside of time and inaccessible to its ravages, the project of organising in this way a sort of perpetual and indefinite accumulation of time in an immobile place, this whole idea belongs to our modernity. The museum and the library are heterotopias that are proper to the western culture of the nineteenth century</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If we consider the <em>Ti’i,</em> described as an ‘Idol from Tahiti’ at the beginning of Ellis’ list, we can imagine its passage between a series of heterotopias, at which confinement was enacted as well as display.</p>\n<p>It likely came from a <em>marae,</em> a ceremonial enclosure in Tahiti where, according to Ellis, <em>Ti’i</em> generally represented the spirits of departed ancestors ‘supposed to be exceedingly irritable and cruel’. They were confined to a house ten or twelve feet off the ground ’to keep them out of the way of men, as it was imagined they were constantly strangling, otherwise destroying the chiefs and people’. They had custodians:</p>\n<p><em>appointed constantly to attend them, and to keep them wrapped in the choicest kinds of cloth, to take them out whenever there was a pae atua, or general exhibition of the gods; to anoint them frequently with fragrant oil; and to sleep in the house with them at night. All this was done, to keep them pacified.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This suggests that the marae was itself a heterotopia at which both confinement and display were deployed as technologies in order to attempt to gain a degree of control over potentially dangerous and disruptive spirits.</p>\n<p>The <em>Ti’i</em> must have escaped the spectacular iconoclastic displays at which similar items were publicly burned in the years after 1815 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>), becoming a ‘prisoner’ of the missionaries – to use the term adopted by both John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>). It may have been displayed from chapel pulpits in Polynesia, in New South Wales, as well across the British Isles.</p>\n<p>The principal idol of Pomare’s family was conveyed around the Independent Chapel in Falmouth, Cornwall, during a Missionary Festival in August 1819 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>). The following year, ‘the abandoned idols which had lately been imported from the islands of the South Seas were exhibited on a platform in front of the pulpit’ during a Missionary meeting at the newly built Carr’s Lane chapel in Birmingham.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Missionary Museum, established in London in 1815,  provided a seemingly permanent place of custody for the majority of ‘idols’ sent from the Pacific, where they could be displayed to visitors, especially when supporters from around the country came to London for the annual ‘missionary week’ meetings in May. The availability of these artefacts at the Missionary Museum allowed them to become the sources for the production of imagery, achieving even wider circulation through missionary publications, books as well as periodicals.</p>\n<p>The Missionary Museum seems to have been a location from which these items continued to circulate for display at missionary meetings elsewhere. It was a central institutional node within a much larger complex, constituted by a shifting network of missionaries and supporters, coordinating the circulation of artefacts between a range of heterotopias. In this, it mirrored the adjacent LMS administrative offices, which oversaw the circulation of funds and information between Mission stations and supporting churches.</p>\n<p>The Missionary Museum confined but also displayed artefacts originally made for display, as what Victor Turner called ‘objects of reflection’, during particular ceremonies, but these were increasingly redeployed as part of what Carol Duncan memorably called <em>Civilizing Rituals.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The despatch of specimens from the Missionary Museum in London to the new training institution at Barmen, part of Rhenish Prussia since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, extended the range of the developing Missionary Exhibitionary Complex, seeding a collection that grew into a substantial Missionary Museum that continues to operate in the twenty-first century. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Similar items were given to missionary institutions in other parts of the world – Tyerman and Bennet presented Polynesian ‘idols’ to the collection of the Baptist Missionary William Carey at Serampore College during their global journey of inspection, which, like the Anglo-Chinese College established at Malacca in 1818 <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/dr-morrisons-chinese-and-english-dictionary/\" target=\"_blank\">(Chapter 9)</a>, maintained its own museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>But the missionary exhibitionary complex was not confined to spaces of display with official missionary associations. As early as May 1799, Captain Wilson of the <em>Duff</em> presented items to the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, established just six years earlier (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a>).</p>\n<p>There seems to have been considerable overlap between misionary supporters and the membership of such societies – the fruits of Britain’s burgeoning ‘civic culture’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In December 1821, John Campbell presented African items to the Royal Dublin Society following his second journey to South Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In addition, George Bennet presented further material to the collections of Literary and Philosophical Societies in Leeds, Sheffield and Saffron Walden.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>William Ellis’ letter, suggesting the items he sent to Barmen would convey ‘a more lively impression’ suggests that they needed to be seen to be believed. The fact that they could be displayed at all, however, reinforced the second part of his statement, ‘shewing what Missionaries had been able to effect’. Such exhibitions allowed the re-formation of society by missionaries to be presented as not only necessary, but possible.</p>\n<p>Tony Bennet positioned the Great Exhibition of 1851, alongside the opening of the new prisons at Mettray in 1840 and Pentonville in 1842, as examples of institutions that brought together disciplines and techniques in ways that guided future institutions. In the case of the Great Exhibition, he suggested these emerged from ‘the previous histories of museums, panoramas, Mechanics’ Institute exhibitions, art galleries and arcades’, and were translated ‘into exhibitionary forms which, in simultaneously ordering objects for public inspection and ordering the public that was inspected’ had a profound and lasting influence on the subsequent development of museums, art galleries, expositions, and department stores’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Martin J. Wiener, by contrast, positioned the 1851 Great Exhibition as ‘an end and not a beginning’ that ‘would see the high-water mark of educated opinion’s enthusiasm for industrial capitalism’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By 1832 we can already find many of the essential techniques deployed at the Great Exhibition operating within the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex. This suggests that we should treat missionary display practices as a significant ancestor within the genealogy of public museums.</p>\n<p>One might counter that the British Museum had been open to the public since 1759, asserting an essentially Enlightenment genealogy for the public museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> I have pointed out elsewhere that the British Museum was significantly transformed during the second half of the nineteenth century, and between 1823 to 1846 was effectively a building site.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A visitor to the British Museum’s ‘Ethnographical room’, a single room displaying British antiquities alongside ‘clubs from the South Seas and trifling objects from China and elsewhere’, after it reopened in 1848 declared:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never was such a disgraceful jumble of things seen, even in a local museum supported by voluntary contributions and regulated by a batch of half-educated provincial antiquaries . . . All our early collectors, Tradescant, and Ashmole, and Thoresby aimed at something like arrangement; but here, in the nineteenth century and in a national museum, we have a collection confounding all the unities of time and place and only worthy of a retired dealer in marine stores. And yet, this is one of the first rooms a foreigner is obliged to see on entering the British Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following its reoperning, on the eve of the 1851 Great Exhibition, the British Museum remained a long way from leading the development of display techniques that came to define the Exhibitionary Complex as it developed during the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly in relation to what became known as ‘ethnographic collections’, from other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Tony Bennet is of course right that ‘the Exhibitionary Complex’ contributed in no small part to the formation of particular kinds of political ‘subjects’, but it did this, at least partly, through the confinement and display of certain kinds of material ‘objects’.</p>\n<p>‘Subject’ and the ‘object’ can fruitfully be regarded as mutually constituting categories, products of what Bruno Latour called the ‘work of purification’ – categorisation and classification being an essential part of the institutional work of museums – life beyond their walls, by contrast, involves an endless proliferation of hybrids.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>1832 is a key moment from which to consider the relationship between heterotopias and society because of significant transformations in the nature of political subjecthood in Britain (paralleled in many ways by the July Revolution in France, of 1830).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to E.P. Thompson:</p>\n<p><em>In the years between 1780 and 1832 most English working people came to feel an identity of interests as between themselves, and against their rulers and employers.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Contemporary observers seem to have been acutely aware of this profound sense of transition – George Eliot famously set her novel <em>Middlemarch</em> between 1829 and 1832, exploring the political reform movement alongside Dr Tertius Lydgate’s attempts to reform a country hospital, with a backdrop provided by the coming of the railways.</p>\n<p>The young John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), a contemporary of Eliot’s fictional Will Ladislaw, declared in a series of essays on <em>The Spirit of the Age,</em> published in 1831:</p>\n<p>The conviction is already not far from being universal, that the times are pregnant with change; and that the nineteenth century will be known to posterity as the era of one of the greatest revolutions of which history has preserved the remembrance, in the human mind, and in the whole constitution of human society. Even the religious world teems with new interpretations of the Prophecies, foreboding mighty changes near at hand. It is felt that men are henceforth to be held together by new ties, and separated by new barriers; for the ancient bonds will no longer unite, nor the ancient boundaries confine.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 1832, William Ellis, approaching the age of 40, understood the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex better than anyone else. As a young gardener, he had been inspired to become a missionary by letters sent by John Campbell from South Africa (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>), and would have seen many of the items collected on that journey at the Missionary museum in London after it opened in April 1815. In October 1816, on his way to the Pacific, Ellis encountered ‘the Idols Gods of Tahiti’, sent by Pomare II, at the Parramatta home of Samuel Marsden, on their way to London (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>).</p>\n<p>After overseeing the printing of the Tahitian spelling book at Mo’orea in 1817, Ellis relocated to Huahine to establish his mission there. Five years later he visited Hawai’i, returning there between February 1823 and September 1824 to assist the work of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. During the first half of 1825, Ellis spent five months speaking to American congregations from a base at Boston, returning to Britain where he worked on the publication of his <em>Narrative of a Tour through Hawaii,</em> published in early 1826 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>).</p>\n<p>Three years later, Ellis published <em>Polynesian Researches</em>, including the detailed descriptions of a range of Polynesian practices cited above, as well as depictions of artefacts at the LMS museum, including a plate depicting ‘idols’ which formed the frontispiece to Volume 2, shown above. Alongside preparing his books for publication, Ellis spent much of the five years following his return travelling around the British Isles promoting the work of the London Missionary Society.</p>\n<p>An illustrative episode took place on 23 May 1829 when Ellis and a number of other LMS representatives arrived at Enniskerry, a village outside Dublin. They were greeted by the evangelical rector, Robert Daly, who declared that although it was supposed to be the quarterly meeting of (Anglican) Church Missionary Society (CMS), the day’s collection would be given to the LMS. Having spoken about the work of the society’s work in Africa, China and the South Seas to around 250 people, Ellis was presented with £13 collected from those present.</p>\n<p>He was then invited to tea at Powerscourt House by the widowed “good Lady Powerscourt” (Theodosia Anne Wingfield, née Howard), who subsequently sponsored and hosted several conferences on biblical prophecy between 1831 and 1833 (possibly those alluded to by Mill). These were attended by John Nelson Darby and Edward Irving, whose views on the coming end of the world led to the establishment of the Plymouth Brethren.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Over tea, Ellis met Elizabeth Tighe, wife of the evangelical hymn writer and a contributor to the Evangelical Magazine, Thomas Kelly, together with their daughters (one of whom was my Gt. Gt. Gt. Grandmother).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was only in 1831 that Ellis adopted a less itinerant lifestyle, first as Assistant and then as Foreign Secretary of the London Missionary Society, when he also seems to have become responsible for the society’s museum and its collection.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In the same year, John Stuart Mill suggested that one could ‘learn in a morning’s walk through London more of the history of England during the nineteenth century, than all the professed English histories in existence will tell him concerning the other eighteen’ and Ellis had, in the course of his missionary journeys, seemingly been everywhere and met everyone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis must have recognised, like Mill, that ‘the old order of things has become unsuited to the state of society and of the human mind’. Mill suggested Britain was in the process of proclaiming ‘almost with one voice’ that the old institutions ‘are vicious both in the outline and in the details, and they <em>shall</em> be renovated, and purified, and made fit for civilised man’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At least part of what he was referring to was the campaign for political reform, culminating in Britain’s Representation of the People Act of 1832, known as the Great Reform Act.</p>\n<p>This saw the removal of pocket and rotten boroughs, controlled by corporate interests, and the granting of parliamentary seats to industrial cities such as Birmingham, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield, which had all grown significantly over the previous three decades. Also newly represented was Manchester, a centre for the industrial manufacture of cotton cloth, where the Peterloo Massacre saw many lives lost at a demonstration demanding parliamentary representation in 1819.</p>\n<p>When Sir Robert Peel, son of a wealthy Lancashire textile manufacturer, became Home Secretary in 1822, he began the development of Britain’s professional police force, intended to govern by consent and regulation, rather than the brutal impositions of state military power, as at Peterloo. The Peterloo massacre also led to the establishment in 1821 of The Manchester Guardian (continuing as The Guardian), founded to:</p>\n<p>Zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious liberty… warmly advocate the cause of Reform… endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy… and support… whatever measures may… tend to promote the moral advantage, or the political welfare, of the Community.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The 1832 extension of the franchise was significant, in part because it demonstrated that constitutional reform was possible, though what it enacted remained a long way from what we might now regard as universal suffrage. It has been estimated that the effect of the bill was to extend the voting franchise in England from around 1 per cent of the population to around 7 per cent, in effect providing a stake in the constitution for the rapidly expanding middle classes.</p>\n<p>In doing so it opened the way for demands for working class representation which played out in the Chartist Movement as the century went on. Further extensions of the franchise followed in 1867 and 1884, also important dates in the history of public museums, suggesting that at least part of the function of the Exhibitionary Complex was to educate, or possibly ‘civilize’ newly enfranchised voters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It might be tempting to regard this as an insular British political history, with few wider implications, but it sheds important light on the establishment of the Tahitian Legislative Assembly, overseen by London Missionary Society representatives in 1824. This gave ordinary Tahitians political representation eight years before similar rights were granted in Britain (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/10-two-of-the-tur-rursna/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a>).</p>\n<p>It is also illuminating to consider John Philip’s campaign for the Cape’s indigenous people, pursued when he returned to London in 1826. Before repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts in 1828 made it possible for Dissenters to hold public office in Britain (similar Emancipation for Catholics followed in 1829, prompting some of the eschatological anxieties of succeeding years), Philip persuaded Thomas Fowell Buxton (leader of Britain’s parliamentary anti-slavery lobby after William Wilberforce retired in 1825) that racial restrictions on the Cape’s indigenous people amounted to slavery by another name.</p>\n<p>Philip’s 1828 book <em>Researches in South Africa</em> assembled a range of evidence in support of his case, but its preface frames his argument in relation to a universalist conception of natural rights, rooted in a particular understanding of divine creation as well as the British constitution:</p>\n<p>Independent of printed statutes, there are certain rights which human beings possess, and of which they cannot be deprived but by manifest injustice. The wanderer in the desert has a right to his life, to his liberty, his wife, his children and his property. The Hottentot has a right to a fair price for his labour; to an exemption from cruelty and oppression; to choose the place of his abode, and to enjoy the society of his children; and no one can deprive him of those rights without violating the laws of nature and of nations… The Hottentots, in addition to the unalienable rights conferred upon them by their Creator, have prescriptive rights in their favour; they are regarded by the British government as a free people; and the colonial law says, that they are to be treated in their persons, in their properties and in their possessions, the same as other free people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When asked by William Huskisson, Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, a man who in 1830 became the first railway fatality in history, to describe what he wanted in one sentence, Philip replied:</p>\n<p>I require nothing for the Hottentots, but the power of bringing their labour to a fair market.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>[^If Napoleon really did call the English “a nation of shopkeepers”, then central to their commercial self-conception was a right to freely exchange their labour for payment – an individual right increasingly asserted by the British Middle and Working classes both for themselves as well as for others.]</p>\n<p>The extension of the franchise in 1832 represented a concession to what Martin Wiener called ‘the English Industrial Spirit’, rooted in the urban areas where evangelical and dissenting churches made up the bulk of supporters of the London Missionary Society. But this local political concession also had significant global consequences. It was the overwhelmingly Whig parliament, elected in 1833, which voted for the Slavery Abolition Act, setting a course that would, in time, make the purchase and ownership of slaves illegal across the British Empire.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Eric Williams’ slightly grumpy comment that ‘The British historians write almost as if Britain had introduced Negro slavery solely for the satisfaction of abolishing it’ has been cited frequently in order to diminish the centrality of white abolitionists within contemporary stories told about slavery and it abolition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While aspects of Williams’ criticism are certainly valid, and are a version of criticisms applied to Whig history in general,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> any decision to abolish slavery is ultimately a decision about the kinds of people we imagine ourselves to be and the society we would like to live in – a point made David Graeber and David Wengrow in making the case for multiple abolitions of slavery in the course of human history in their 2021 book <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In a 1920 essay on ‘The Nation’, Marcel Mauss suggested that ‘Societies live by borrowing from each other, but they define themselves rather by the refusal of borrowing than by its acceptance’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The British abolition of slavery was arguably just such a refusal, providing a defining moment for the newly enfranchised British middle classes, who, at least initially, defined themselves largely in opposition to the aristocratic and plutocratic 1% who had previously governed them, and who had been the major beneficiaries of the economic system established to enable the Trans-Atlantic trade.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Boyd Hilton has characterised Britain’s <em>Age of Atonement</em> between 1785 and 1865 in relation to a theology of Grace, centred on the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It also involved a project of national atonement, at least partly in relation to Britain’s earlier enthusiastic participation in slave trading. Just as the script of conversion required a recognition of earlier sinfulness and redemption through acceptance of divine Grace, so conversion of the nation entailed the recognition of sin – what John Newton, an active participant in the slave trade before becoming a powerful voice in the early abolition movement called ‘this stain on our National character’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although slavery and its legacies remain largely offstage in George Eliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em>, apart from Will Ladislaw’s declaration that he intends to take up Wilberforce’s cause of ‘Negro Emancipation’, it is surely significant that money and its sources recurs as a theme throughout the novel, exemplified in the ‘ill-gotten’ fortune of the country financier Bulstrode. While this ultimately derived from a pawnbroking business, which profited from stolen goods and the distress of ‘lost souls’, many fortunes in contemporary British society were built on foundations of slavery.</p>\n<p>While the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex’ involved a great deal of ‘othering’ in relation to what Ellis called ‘the actual degradation of the heathen’, the point was surely to demonstrate the possibility of reform and ultimately of redemption.</p>\n<p>If heterotopias are, in Foucault’s terms, ‘counter-sites’, then the places of display constituted by the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex provided a kind of fulcrum around which a re-formation of the self could be attempted. In seeking to rescue the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex from ‘the enormous condescension of posterity’, it becomes necessary to demonstrate the multiple ways in which it was implicated within projects of societal reform and improvement, the consequences of which continue to have global implications.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1938, on the eve of the Second World War, just as other European Jews were being denied their political personhood and associated rights, the great French Anthropologist Marcel Mauss gave the Huxley Memorial Lecture in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He attempted to lay out developing constructions of political citizenship, what he called the Category of the Person, ‘from the simple masquerade to the mask, from a ‘role’ (<em>personnage</em>) to a ‘person’ (<em>personne</em>), to a name, to an individual’ – taking in Roman legal distinctions between citizens and slaves, as well as a recognition of the conscious moral person among the Stoics and early Christians.</p>\n<p>In the context of understanding an equation made in in recent times between political personhood and consciousness, he suggested:</p>\n<p>We cannot exaggerate the importance of sectarian movements throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for the formation of political and philosophical thought. There it was that were posed the questions regarding individual liberty, regarding the individual conscience and the right to communicate directly with God, to be one’s own priest, to have an inner God. The ideas of the Moravian Brothers, the Puritans, the Wesleyans and the Pietists are those which form the basis on which is established the notion: the ‘person’ (<em>personne)</em> equals the ‘self’ (<em>moi)</em>; the ‘self; (<em>moi</em>) equals consciousness (<em>conscience)</em>, and is its primordial category.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In concluding his lecture, Mauss asked whether ‘the sacred character of the human ‘person’ (<em>personne</em>)’ would continue to be recognised, suggesting its moral force was questioned throughout Asia, as well as in the countries where the principle was discovered (a reference to contemporary Germany). He then commented ‘We have great possessions to defend, with us the idea could disappear’ before resuming a more scientific attitude, ‘Let’s not moralise’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>To be socially recognised as a person is to be literally enfranchised – granted a  role in the political and judicial decisions of one’s society. Britain’s 1832 expansion of the political franchise was a watershed moment in the process of renegotiating what it meant to be a political and legal person – a literal re-constitution of society. It is significant that political reform ‘at home’ essentially coincided with the granting of equivalent rights to free colonised people at the Cape, as well as the abolition of slavery across the British colonies, all achievements in which newly powerful evangelical networks were significantly implicated.</p>\n<p>What 1832 allows us to see is nothing less than the beginnings of an institutional re-formation of society around a new conception of the person – the self conscious rights-bearing individual – who would also acquire, in Foucault’s terms, the ‘right to her or his own little box for her or his own little personal decay’. If the municipal cemetery, relocated to the outskirts of town, is one type of heterotopia reflecting this transformation, then the centrally located public museum, confining and displaying singular labelled objects within glass boxes, is another.</p>\n<p>Within the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex, however, it was the converted Polynesians of Tahiti, the Cook Islands and Hawai’i, rather than the contemporary British or French, who were initially framed as exemplary ‘moderns’. They had freed themselves from the demands of troublesome ancestors and ‘false gods’, now consigned to the Missionary Museum, in order to re-construct their societies around a Christian conception of God. Contemporary evangelicals presumably recognised that in 1832, this project remained a work in progress within Europe itself.</p>\n<p>On 5 May 1834, Wilhelm Richter, a tutor at the Rhenish Mission College in Barmen wrote to tell William Ellis in London that:</p>\n<p>The valuable presents you maid [sic] to our Society have contributed very much indeed to awaken the missionary spirit among us; even people who formerly did not a all care about missionary cares, came to see the Idols etc., and have a good deal of money, being very much struck with the blindness of the poor Heathen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fnref62\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">62</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October of the same year, Leipoldt himself ended a letter to Ellis by asking for ‘more curiosities out of the heathen world, as our people take a very great interest in shares idols and other curiosities which you kindly have sent to us some years ago’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Among the congregations supporting the Rhenish Missionary Society at the time was a young teenage boy, whose father owned a textile factory. Published when he was nineteen, his <em>Letters from Wuppertal</em> described the consequences of industrialisation in the Wupper valley around Barmen, as well as the contradictions of the bourgeois hypocrisy in which he had been raised:</p>\n<p>For it is a fact that the pietists among the factory owners treat their workers worst of all; they use every possible means to reduce the workers’ wages on the pretext of denying them of the opportunity to get drunk, yet at the election of preachers they are always the first to bribe their people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his subsequent description of the <em>Condition of the Working Class in England,</em> first published in 1845, Friedrich Engels told his German-speaking readers that:</p>\n<p>The Industrial Revolution is of the same importance for England as the political revolution for France, and the philosophical revolution for Germany; and the difference between England in 1760 and in 1844 is at least as great as that between France under the <em>ancient r_é_gime</em> and during the revolution of July. But the mightiest result of the industrial transformation is the English proletariat.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Subsequently collaborating with and supporting another Rhenish boy, Karl Marx, Engels seems to have imbibed the missionary message that fetishes and idols were a bad thing, but increasingly directed this critique at European industrial society itself.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I am extremely grateful to Rachel Hand for drawing my attention to donation of missionary material to the Royal Dublin Society, as well as to Christoph Schwab, Curator at the Archiv- und Museumsstiftung der VEM in Wuppertal, for sharing a scanned copy of the letter from Ellis, together with the list with which this chapter begins. It was such unanticipated connections that demonstrated some of the ways in which an ‘imagined community’ of evangelicals and their Missionary Exhibitionary Complex transcended political borders.</p>\n<p>I am also grateful to David Wengrow for a long friendship, extending back to an excavation in Lesotho in 1998. His 2021 book with David Graeber, <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>, has stimulated me to reflect in this chapter on the peculiarity of British configurations of political subjecthood, as well as their global implications.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Parts of a letter he had sent to the Rev.

Charles Mead, who returned to England soon afterwards, they represented Pattera-Kalee (Bhadrakali) and Veerapathiran (Virabhadra), female and male emanations of the wrath of Shiva, with ‘faces painted to give them a terrific appearance’. Their faces were soon removed with an Indian spade (mamatee). While paid labourers cleared ‘the rubbish’:</p>\n<p>We retired to the veranda of the temple, sung a Tamil hymn, read the 10<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, addressed the people from the 20<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> verse, and concluded with prayer. The people were delighted with the overthrow of the the idols; and subsequently began daily to assemble to hear the Scriptures read, and to join in prayer, where satanic worship was once performed. After the service was over, the image of Paramasattee was brought out of an adjoining room, and we rescued it from the flames with a view of bringing it to England, where it has safely arrived.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning to his Mission House at Neyoor (Neyyoor) ‘before the sun was very powerful’, Mead found that Martha and Charles Mault, fellow missionaries from Nagercoil just over 8 miles away, had come to see him before he left:</p>\n<p>When reviewing what the Gospel had effected for Travancore, since we first entered the field, we could not avoid saying, and our friends in Britain will join in the exclamation, ‘What hath God wrought!’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead clearly detected the hand of God in the changes he had seen over two decades in India, regarding his own part in these as contributing to a long-term war against what he called ‘satanic worship’. Indeed, the verse he preached from at the temple comes from a letter that was written by St Paul to the people of Corinth during the first century AD.</p>\n<p>It warns them not to consume sacrifices made at idolatrous altars, since these had been made to demons. Pointing out that consumption of the eucharist underlies the fellowship of Christians, Paul told the Corinthians ‘I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Charles Mead had originally been appointed to succeed William Tobias Ringeltaube, a Prussian minister trained at the University of Halle who established the London Missionary Society’s mission in South India. Born in 1770, Ringeltaube’s missionary ambitions were inspired by John Newton (Chapter 2 &amp; 12), going first to Calcutta in 1796 with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He returned to Europe in 1799, complaining that he had been forced to preach in Portuguese to ‘a mixed congregation of Portuguese, Malays, Jews and Chinese’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ringeltaube was appointed by the London Missionary Society in 1803, along with four others intended for India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). They arrived at the Danish colony of Tranquebar (Tharangambadi) in December 1804, where Pietist missionaries had been operating since 1706. Seeking guidance from another German-speaking SPCK missionary, John Caspar Kohlhoff, Ringeltaube began learning Tamil before taking responsibility for Palamcottah (Palayamkottai) in Tinnevelly (Tirunelveli), on behalf of Kohlhoff.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Around this time, Kohlhoff seems to have introduced Ringeltaube to Maharasan Vedamanickam, a Christian convert he had baptised some years earlier. Vedaminanickam came from Mylaudy (Mayiladi) in the Kingdom of Travancore (now part of Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district), close to India’s southern tip. Ringeltaube began paying regular visits to Vedamanickam’s village, ultimately assisting him to begin to build a Church in 1809.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Travancore had been in a subsidiary alliance with the British East India Company since 1795, but conflict over a new treaty in 1805 enabled the Company to consolidate its influence. The Company’s resident, Colin Macaulay, was the son of a Church of Scotland minister and brother to Zachary Macaulay, one of the leaders of the evangelical campaign to abolish slavery in London. It was presumably Colin Macaulay who negotiated with the Maharaja of Travancore for the permission for  Vedamanickam’s church.</p>\n<p>In 1812, Ringeltaube moved to Mylaudy, but facing health problems, in 1816 he ordained Vedamanickam and sailed to Ceylon. He evidently planned to recover in South Africa, but seems to have died en route.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Although Mead never met Ringeltaube, it was into his shoes that he stepped when he arrived in late 1817, his first wife having died on the journey.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He found the Church had thrived under Vedamanickam’s care, with seven chapels, five or six schools and around 900 converts and candidates for baptism.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Macauley had been replaced as the Company’s local resident in 1810 by another reforming Scot, John Munro, who was appointed Dewan (Prime Minister) of the Kingdom of Travancore between 1811 and 1814. Munro retained considerable influence at the court, and persuaded the young Rani (Queen Regent), Gowri Parvati Bayi, to provide Mead with a bungalow at Nagercoil, four miles from Myladi, as well as 5000 rupees to purchase rice fields to support the seminary he proposed to establish.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This patronage formed part of the official embrace of missionary education by the Kingdom of Travancore, in parallel with the 1813 alteration to the East India Company’s charter (Chapter 6), which had introduced an obligation to introduce ‘useful knowledge’ as well as ‘religious and moral improvement’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1819, Mead was joined at Nagercoil by Charles and Martha Mault (née Mead, who evidently traced her descent from Britain’s seventeenth century Puritan leader, Oliver Cromwell).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Charles Mead and Charles Mault divided responsibility for surrounding villages between them, but it was only after the visit of George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman in 1827 (more below) that Mead moved to Neyoor, in the mission’s Western division.</p>\n<p>​An image of ‘Pattera-Kalee and Veerapathiran’ was printed on the cover of the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> in September 1837, under the title ’Demon Worship in South Travancore’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mead’s account of destruction, quoted above, was printed beneath this image, but its source is unclear since the figures are shown standing, while his description suggests those destroyed were reclining.</p>\n<p>The appearance of such images on the title page of the <em>Chronicle</em> was a fairly recent innovation. Although the quarterly <em>Missionary Sketches</em> had featured striking images on its covers since its first issue in April 1818 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>), the monthly <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> continued to feature just a single portrait each month, a practice established with the magazine in 1793 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>). This had continued even after its title expanded to <em>The Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</em> when a distinct <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> section was added at the end of the magazine in June 1813.</p>\n<p>In June 1836, however, an editorial addressed ‘To the Members and Friends of the London Missionary Society’ appeared under a banner, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle (relating chiefly to the Missions of the London Missionary Society)</em>. This stated that the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> would now be made available independently, but still continue as the final section in <em>the Evangelical Magazine</em>. Some surviving copies of <em>the Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> after this date have different page numbers to those included with <em>the Evangelical Magazine,</em> as well as an issue number and date included as a header (compare the covers for 1836 to those from 1837 shown here), but otherwise appear to be identical.</p>\n<p>A significant change introduced in 1836, however, was the addition of a cover image for the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle.</em> The first image, for July 1836, shows a rather dramatic scene at Kristnapore, a Missionary Station in Bengal, with the title ‘Peril from the Boa Constrictor’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Flooding caused by hurricanes seems to have displaced an eighteen foot long snake into the mission compound, where it was rather dramatically killed and its skin sent to the Missionary Museum in London.</p>\n<p>The October 1836 cover featured a depiction of ‘Worship of the Serpent in India’, followed in March 1837 by an image of ‘Serpent Charmers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It seems likely that this recurring serpentine theme may have been initiated by an issue of <em>Missionary Sketches</em> back in April 1833, where the cover featured ‘Representations of the Serpent-God Worshipped in India’, with images of two carvings from the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>That on the left, where ‘the hood of the serpent forms a kind of screen behind and canopy over the form of the idol’, was sent by John Hands, LMS missionary at Bellary (Ballari) between 1810 and 1841. The other,  ‘designated <em>Nagur Swamy</em> [Naga Swamy], the serpent-god, is among the renounced idols that have recently arrived from Travancore’.</p>\n<p>The text which follows begins by declaring that ’The serpent appears to have been one of the earliest objects of idolatrous worship, and has been held in universal veneration’. From the ‘mythology of the Chaldeans and Egyptians’ to the ‘uncivilised aborigines of South America’, the serpent was declared to have been ‘regarded with superstitious reverence by a large portion of the human race, especially in the eastern parts of the world’, with the <em>Naga</em> described as ‘among the thirty thousand imaginary gods of India’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The text then includes a description of Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet’s visit to a temple in Allahabad in August 1826, where they encountered an ‘idol’ in the form of a five headed serpent. It explained that Nagercoil, the location for the main LMS mission in South Travancore, literally translated means temple of the serpent. Visited by Tyerman and Bennet in July 1827, their account of the weekly feeding of resident snakes by priests was also printed, including their unsuccessful attempt to purchase one of the foot-high serpent representations from the wall of the temple. These were described as mostly ‘offerings presented by women, in consequence of vows which they have made to the god’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The text that follows notes that in the last six months of 1831, 113 families from Nagercoil had renounced Hinduism, seeking Christian instruction at mission schools now responsible for teaching between 16,000 and 17,000 students. At Neyoor, a further 3000 people were said to have ‘forsaken heathenism’, with 160 families added during 1831 alone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While Charles Mead remained the sole European male missionary resident at Neyoor, the text explained that he was assisted by an Indian ‘superintendent of schools, fourteen readers, and twenty-six assistant readers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mead’s 1832 report referred ‘to the village of Paenguddy, where the inhabitants delivered up the serpent-idol, represented in the first page of this sketch’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p><em>Missionary Sketches</em> was quick to remind readers that:</p>\n<p>Every instance in which the objects of heathen veneration are either discarded or destroyed, should excite our devout thanksgiving, and impart greater fervency to prayer, while we regard it as an earnest of the arrival of that period, in which, referring to the purposes of the Most High, it is declared “the idols he shall utterly abolish.” These indicate that God is working by the means now employed for effecting this…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An excerpt from Mead’s report summarised his efforts to establish a school house at the village of Careavilly (Kariavili) in the grounds of the temple, referred to as ‘the principal devil house in these parts next to Mundacadoo’ (Mandaikadu).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead explained that some of the owners of the temple had converted to Christianity, and the school house was intended to become a focus for Christian worship during the evenings. He thought that the ‘Pagoda will no longer be used as a place of heathen worship’ but would either be removed or allowed to decay, suggesting that ‘the latter is thought to be the most advisable mode of rooting out idolatry from the place’. Mead explained:</p>\n<p>The heathen hold the pagoda in great veneration, and if any thing was done that looked too much like a triumph over them, it might be resented and occasion opposition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A much bolder approach seems to have been adopted at what seems to have been the same temple a mere four years later, according to Mead’s account of destruction from the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> of 1837. The overall strategy of converting the temple into a location for Christian worship, however, seems to have remained the same.</p>\n<p>The final paragraph from <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in April 1833 provides an insight into the preoccupations of those responsible for commissioning the multiple serpentine images for LMS publications in subsequent years, suggesting:</p>\n<p>The extensive and valuable labours of the native readers, the numbers under Christian instruction… and the attentive behaviour of the native congregations in places of worship, unite to endorse on every disciple of Christ more fervent and persevering prayer, for the influences of the Holy Spirit a savour of life… and thus to accelerate the arrival of the period, when the worship of the serpent, and every other delusive idolatry promoted by the great destroyer of our race, who, under the form of a serpent, introduced sin and all its degradations and penalties to our world, shall be discontinued…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For British Christians like Charles Mead, raised on an account of temptation and fall in which a serpent played the leading role, it must have been obvious that the reverence paid to snakes in the form of <em>Naga Swamy</em> at places like Nagercoil was a form of ‘devil worship’, indicating the ongoing influence of Satan, ‘the great destroyer of our race’.</p>\n<p>In describing the annual festival at nearby Mandaikadu in 1837, Mead emphasised that it was a ‘place of devil worship’, describing a ‘swinging machine’ which hoisted devotees using a ‘hook inserted in the back’. He described how children who had recovered from illnesses were made to dance with ‘a thin piece of cane inserted in their side’, even hinting that the resident ‘demon’ was said to require a human sacrifice every thousand years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Missionary work, situated in this way, was understood as a contribution to a very long-term cosmic battle, in which conversions and the renunciation of ‘idols’ suggested the scales might be tipping.</p>\n<p>Mead’s account of the destruction of the ‘idols’ at Kariavili, printed in the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle in</em> September 1837_,_ was followed with news of a Memorial, presented to the Governor of Madras by over two hundred local British residents, protesting at ‘Government Support of Idolatry in India’, referred to as ‘this dark blot on the Christian character of the British nation’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The next article described the ‘Conversion of Roman Catholics at Salem’, also in South India, followed by an extract from the journal of Indian evangelists at Chittoor, as well as a ’Translation of a Sermon Preached at Benares’ (Varanasi).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The issue’s focus on India was rounded off with brief news of missions in South Africa and Berbice (now part of Guyana), as well as an anniversary Missionary meeting in Manchester that raised nearly £3,000. The magazine ended by listing a series of more modest financial ‘Missionary Contributions’, as well as letters received from overseas Missionaries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The following month, the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> returned to ‘Demon Worship in South Travancore’, continuing Charles Mead’s ‘account of this decaying but abhorrent superstition’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On the cover an apparently accurate image of ‘Paramasattee’ was printed, with which Mead had returned to London, imagined under a Banyan tree at night, small flames rising from the many spoon-shaped attachments attached to her front.</p>\n<p>Mead’s account resumes:</p>\n<p>The name Paramasattee literally signifies, ‘heavenly virtue, or strength.’ This demon, though frightful in appearance, is accounted no less a personage than the wife of heavenly Seevan [Shiva]. The image, which is formed of wood, was usually concealed from public view, except on great occasions, when it was brought out and worshipped in connection with Pattera-kalee [Bhadrakali]. There is a great assumption of mystery connected with the worship of this evil spirit.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead seems to have derived much of his understanding of the function of this image from a former priest at the temple, described as ‘a very interesting man, more than seventy years of age’, who was now ‘a converted character’ following baptism as a Christian. He seems to have told the missionary that the many spoon-shaped vessels were used as lamps, holding oil and wicks, lit during temple festivals to create ‘an imposing appearance, when placed in the shade of a banyan tree, on a dark night’:</p>\n<p>These lamps are intended to represent the letters of the alphabet, which are repeated when the image is worshipped; and there are several Tamil letters carved on the image itself. Five of the letters are held as sacred and mystic, and the very repetition of them, it is said, ‘consumed the sins’ of a certain Rajah: they form the mysterious word, Na-ma-se-va-ya.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to Mead, when the figures of Pattera-kalee (Bhadrakali) was destroyed, the same former priest told the people:</p>\n<p>You used to come to the pagoda with your offerings, and ask me to dance before the idols until the evil spirits came on me; then I would tell you what to do. It was all false and wicked; but we did this until the Missionaries and the native teachers came to enlighten us. Now by the blessing of God our eyes are opened. Some of us have long since abandoned the devil’s service. I am glad I am no longer his slave. Let us be stedfast, and endeavour to show others the true way to salvation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While it may be tempting to regard the destruction and removal of religious artefacts as a straightforward imposition of colonialism, this probably fails to recognise the degree to which these events emerged from the actions of people like this former priest, as well as Vedamanickam, who began the process of conversion in South Travancore before European missionaries came to his village.</p>\n<p>Arriving in Britain at the end of March 1837, Charles Mead was able to attend the London Missionary Society’s Annual Public Meeting at Exeter Hall in London on 11 May. It proved to be the largest and the longest annual meeting of the Society’s four decades long history. It was attended by a fair number of people with overseas missionary experience, in China (Rev. W.H. Medhurst – Chapter 16), the Pacific (Rev. John Williams – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>, &amp; 15), South Africa (Rev. Dr. John Philip, Rev. James Read and Jan Tzatzoe – Chapter 15 &amp; 31), Madagascar (Rev. J.J. Freeman – Chapter 19), as well as several others who had worked in India ( Rev. Richard Knill, Rev. E. Crisp, Rev. J. Crowther – a Wesleyan Methodist, Rev. George Gogerley, Rev. William Campbell).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The meeting began with a report from William Ellis, Foreign Secretary (Chapter 13), who provided a listing of the society’s missions, summarised numerically into three columns in the printed account of the meeting; ‘stations and outstations’; ‘missionaries’ and ‘assistants, native, &amp;c<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Stations and Out-Stations</th>\n<th>Missionaries</th>\n<th>Assistants, Native, &amp;c.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>South Seas</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultra Ganges</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>East Indies</td>\n<td>310</td>\n<td>36</td>\n<td>375</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Russia</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mediterranean</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>South Africa and African Islands</td>\n<td>31</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>West Indies</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>428</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>482</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These figures make it clear that the East Indies stood out in comparison to other regions, partly because of the number of ‘stations and out-stations’ (310), but especially because of the large number of ‘Assistants, Native. &amp;c.’ (375). While the second and third columns assert an essentially racial distinction between European ‘Missionaries’ and local ‘Assistants’, it is clear that in India, unlike the other regions, there were ten times more ‘Assistants’ that ‘Missionaries’. The East Indies also had the largest number of European ‘Missionaries’ (36) with seven more than in ‘South African and African Islands’ (29), but there were over 300 more ‘Assistants’ in India (375) than the South Seas (70), which has the second largest number in that column.</p>\n<p>The first person to address the Exeter Hall meeting after Ellis was James Montgomery from Sheffield, a journalist who had edited the journals made by Tyerman and Bennet as part of their deputation tour of LMS mission stations, published six years earlier. He noted the need for missionaries in the West Indies following the abolition of slavery (Chapter 18), ongoing conversions across the Pacific, the difficulties of pursuing a mission in China (Chapter 17) as well as in the ‘wilderness of South Africa’ (Chapter 16), but suggested:</p>\n<p>In India, within the last forty years, there are evidences that the chains of caste, as well as Satan’s 300,000 representatives under the name of idols will be done away there, as well as in other parts of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Next to speak was Charles Mead, reflecting on twenty years in Travancore, and the opposition he faced from ‘The Brahmins – the rich, the mighty, and the noble’. He reported that at his mission at Neyoor, a copy of the New Testament had recently been presented ‘to every native Christian on the station, who was able to read’. He also told the meeting that each of the eighty villages connected to Neyoor and Nagercoil had a place of worship and a school, with 6000 boys and 200 girls currently under instruction.</p>\n<p>At the end of his speech, Mead provided a slightly different account of the destruction at the temple in Kariavili to that printed the following September:</p>\n<p>The people wished me to attend a meeting for the purpose of destroying a large temple, containing two images. On my arrival, I found them all assembled and very much interested. They said, “The evil spirits, which these images represent, have been long troubling the neighbourhood, and several of us have for some time given up our idolatry. Now we wish these relics to be entirely removed, but no one has the courage to do it.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead apparently told them that ‘we would have it removed’ only ‘if they could show it was their property’. He was given ‘the signatures of eighteen persons, saying they would freely give up the temple to us, to do what we pleased with it’, ending his speech with a mention of Paramassattee:</p>\n<p>The other image was a wooden idol – the people wished to burn it, but, as it was rather portable, I proposed to bring it home, telling them, that when you saw that they were casting away their idols, it would be some proof to you of their desire to become true Christians.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It seems that Christianity may have represented a new form of freedom for many converts, liberating them from inherited forms of power, including the powers of what were referred to as ‘evil spirits’. Nearly a quarter of a century later, readers of the Juvenile Missionary Magazine were told of Paramasattee, the ‘tall, curious looking wooden idol’ shown on the left of an image of the case of ‘The Buddhist and Other Idols’ at the Missionary museum, that:</p>\n<p>“Ignorant and unwise,” the simple people stare with wonder at this strange sight, and are quite ready to believed that Paramasattee is indeed a great god.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The testimony reported by Mead, however, seems clear that temple images were not regarded as gods in their own right, but rather as representations or and vessels for spirits, as in Polynesia (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a>). Nevertheless, there remained an understandable nervousness about being the one to wield a spade against them.</p>\n<p>On his return London, Charles Mead presented Paramasattee as a battle trophy in the cosmic war against Satan. European missionaries working in India at around this time, however, seem to have been fully aware that the adoption of Christianity by large numbers of people in South Travancore emerged from a series of far more immediate and local conflicts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The majority of early converts in Travancore belonged to caste groups that were at the time referred to as Shánar (known since 1921 as Nadar), as well as Pariah (Paraiyar). These had a fairly lowly status within the Kingdom, which was dominated by Nair (or Nayar) and Brahmin caste groups, who had developed a range of ways of asserting their status. These included various forms of compulsory labour, including at temples, but also prohibitions on lower castes wearing clothing above the waist, carrying umbrellas, wearing shoes or golden ornaments.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When converted Christian women began wearing clothing on their upper bodies, this was regarded as asserting a privilege properly reserved for the higher castes. Violent confrontations as well as legislative responses followed after 1827, and it was not until 1859 that Nadar women in Travancore gained the legal right to cover their breasts, although not in the same way at Nair women.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Concern for the lives of women seems to have become a significant dimension of early missionary work at Nagercoil, driven in no small part by the arrival of Martha Mault. She established a girl’s boarding school in 1819, although female education seems to have been regarded somewhat suspiciously, including by many new Christians converts, at least initially.</p>\n<p>In 1821, Martha Mault began to teach lace-making to her female students, after they had learned how to read and write. By 1827, there were forty girls at her school in Nagercoil, twelve learning lace-making.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mault’s efforts have been connected to contemporary British gender ideologies of ‘women’s work’, emphasising ‘separate spheres’ as part of a ‘mission of domesticity’, but they also appear to have been underpinned by a series of fairly practical aims.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Firstly, the sale of lace created a source of income that supported the costs of running her school. Secondly, lace-making was seen as a way to enable enslaved girls to build up a financial surplus with which to purchase their liberty. Girls in this position were evidently prioritised when it came to teaching these skills, and by 1830 Martha Mault reported that eight girls had emancipated themselves in this way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Many former students from ‘Mrs Mault’s school’ went on to become the wives of Christian ‘Native teachers’ as well as village school mistresses in their own right.  While many more boys than girls were educated at mission schools in South Travancore, Martha Mault’s educational project, combining literacy with needlework, seems to have struck a chord with women across Evangelical networks all over the world.</p>\n<p>Groups of British women came together to fund the education of particular girls – by 1830, 22 girls were supported in this way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Some of these girls were even given names by their supporters, possibly to commemorate deceased female relatives and friends. ‘Ladies’ at St. Neots, the town in Huntingdonshire where Martha Mault grew up, raised £2 and 5 shillings each year ‘for the support of “Sarah Franklin”’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Charles Mead spoke at Exeter Hall in May 1837, he told the meeting:</p>\n<p>I have in my hand the writing of a little girl, named Elizabeth Fletcher, who is supported by the church at Stepney. It is the second Epistle of St. John, and it is written on a palmyra leaf, with an iron pen. It is novel sight in India, to witness females reading and writing, but their parents are now anxious for their instruction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Considerable funds were also raised for Travancore schools beyond Britain. A donation of £12 from Leonora Gaussen on behalf of the ‘Ladies Association for Female Education’ in Geneva was received in November 1837,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> followed by a further £14-10 in March 1838.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Richard Knill, who initially travelled to India with Charles Mead and assisted him establish the mission at Nagercoil, was appointed as a minister at St Petersburg in Russia by the London Missionary Society after his return to London in 1820. His congregation raised funds for the Nagercoil mission,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> continuing even after Knill returned to London in 1833.</p>\n<p>A key supporter of the LMS was Sarah Biller (née Kilham), who formed part of an influential group of evangelical (and Quaker) women in the city.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Another St Petersburg Quaker, Daniel Wheeler, appointed to manage Russian imperial farms by Tsar Alexander, felt called to visit missions in the Pacific, setting off with his son in late 1833, only to return in early May 1838.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Martha Mault herself returned to Britain in September 1833, ironically perhaps, at least partly to arrange for the education of her own five children.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fnref57\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">57</a></sup> Nevertheless, she used the opportunity to raise funds and solicit interest in ‘female education’ in India.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>  Following her return to Travancore in October 1835, she arranged for a circular letter to be printed at Nagercoil, to send to her supporters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of these, dated 7 September 1836, has survived in the archives of the Council for World Mission in London, having been sent to the Foreign Secretary, William Ellis. The first printed line reads ‘My dear Madam’, although the last word has been crossed out and replaced with Sir, suggesting that Ellis was probably the only male recipient of one of these letters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mault reported that when she returned, there were 62 boarders and 10 day scholars at her school in Nagercoil, but 38 more boarders were soon added. Miss McGregor, who returned with her in 1835 in order to marry the missionary Charles Miller, soon established her own school at Neyoor with a further 35 students. Mault reported that by September 1836, they had between them 145 girls ‘under our immediate inspection’, with a similar number taught at village schools.</p>\n<p>The circular acknowledges that ‘most of the higher castes are still averse to having their daughters instructed’ but suggested that ‘as the benefits of education become more apparent by its wider diffusion among the lower ranks, the higher will be compelled to educate their daughters too’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The final paragraphs of the letter explained that each girl was instructed for four years, unless they needed to stay longer, but that ‘the simplicity of their food and dress enables us to keep a girl at the trifling expense of forty five shillings per annum’.</p>\n<p>Following their visit to Nagercoil in 1827,  George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman noted:</p>\n<p>We are most highly gratified with the state of the general aspect of this Mission… There is nothing, as far as we have seen, equal to it in all India, and we were strongly reminded of what we had so often witnessed in the South Seas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They also noted:</p>\n<p>The girls’ school, under the care of Mrs. Mault (of whom we cannot speak too highly), is in an excellent state, and does her exertions much credit. Twelve of these girls learn to make lace, some of which is exceedingly well done…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Tyerman and Bennet were thwarted when they attempted to acquire an ‘idol’ at the temple in Nagercoil, they do seem to have been presented with a sample of locally made lace by Martha Mault. It survived, pinned to a note written by George Bennet describing its source, at the headquarters of the Council for World Mission in London, where I encountered it in August 2010.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As an artefact, this fragment, now at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich in London (Chapter 32), has the potential to say at least as much about the early Travancore  mission, with its complex and changing dynamics of caste and gender, as the figure of Paramasattee, now kept on the other side of the river Thames, at the British Museum.</p>\n<p>It finds a curious echo in a length of lace from the collection of the V&amp;A Museum in South Kensington, where a printed green label states ‘London Missionary Society, Lace Industry, Nagercoil, S. India’ (<a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O315374/insertion-unknown/\" target=\"_blank\">V&amp;A T.195-1993</a>). Below this, a hand-written price in Rupees suggests that it was purchased in India, perhaps with the intention of using it as a decorative edging. How many other examples of Nagercoil lace survive in museum collections, without such labels, incorporated into other garments?</p>\n<p>Annette Weiner, who undertook doctoral fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands, six decades after Bronislaw Malinowski, found he had significantly underestimated the role played by women in the Kula exchange system, described in his famous 1922 book <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific.</em> While men were concerned with enhancing their status through the exchange of shell valuables, women developed an elaborate technology for ‘making wealth out of dried banana leaves’, which Weiner came to regard as paralleled by female practices of textile production all over the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Introducting her 1992 theoretical book, <em>Inalienable Possessions</em>, Weiner suggested that:</p>\n<p>In many societies throughout the world, however, women are the producers and, in part or wholly, the controllers of highly valued possessions – a currency of sorts made from “cloth”. Intricate symbolic meanings semantically encode sexuality, biological reproduction, and nurturance so that such possessions, as they are exchanged between people, act as the material agents in the reproduction of social relations….<br>\nHistorically, women’s control over these arenas has accorded them powers associated with magical potency, sacred prerogatives, political legitimacy, and life-giving and life-taking social controls.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Lace making in England, like the production of banana leaf fibres in the Trobriands, can be regarded as involving the production of ‘a currency of sorts made from “cloth”’. In the East of England, where Martha Mault came from, lace-making was linked to the history of Protestantism, having arrived with French and Flemish refugees from continental wars of religion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>\n<p>Lace formed an important and valuable part of middle-class female dress, with inherited items of ‘antique lace’ treasured as family heirlooms, playing a role in key English life-cycle ceremonies – baptisms, weddings and funerals. During the nineteenth century, although lace making was increasingly mechanised, making lace by hand survived ‘as a means of occupying spare time’ among middle class women.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Indeed, work produced in this way was increasingly sold to generate funds to support missionary work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alongside a description of mechanised lace-making in Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, Friedrich Engels observed in 1844 that hand-made lace continued to be commercially produced in Northampton, Oxford and Bedford, where lace ‘schools’, effectively small-scale workshops, exploited the children of the poor. Summarising, he suggested:</p>\n<p>This is the price at which society purchases for the fine ladies of the bourgeoisie the pleasure of wearing lace; a reasonable price truly! Only a few thousand blind working men, some consumptive labourers’ daughters, a sickly generation of the vile multitude bequeathing its debility to its equally “vile” children and children’s children.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Did the introduction of lace-making in South Travancore simply mark the expansion of similar forms of exploitation to an Indian context? A century later, Mahatma Gandhi deployed the production of Khadi cloth by hand as a symbol of dignity in labour as part of the <em>swadeshi</em> movement. Is it implausible to suggest that lace-making as form of economic self-empowerment within the female-directed educational setting of ‘Mrs Mault’s school’ at Nagercoil, suggests something similar may have been at play in missionary contexts?</p>\n<p>At the end of her book <em>Inalienable Possessions</em>, Annette Weiner argued that:</p>\n<p>Understanding the scope and limits of gender-based power in the ethnographic record demands giving serious attention to the essential domains in which women participate in economic and political actions in their own right with their own resources. Since the ethnographic examples from which traditional economic theories are formulated rely almost exclusively on examples of men’s production and men’s exchanges, the reproductive energies in such things as women’s bones, sacred cloth, hair strings, banana-leaf bundles, weaving poles, and birthing houses, are largely unrecognised or, when recorded, are reduced by anthropologists to prosaic categories lacking economic or political provenience.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In moving from the destruction of temple sculptures to the production of lace, I have attempted to demonstrate some of the ways in which these seemingly distinct practices remained intimately connected. The transformations associated with the widespread adoption of Christianity by marginalised castes in South Travancore pitted the temple, a focus for existing ideas and practices surrounding fertility, where many dedications were evidently made by women, against the school, where at least some women gained new forms of economic power, clothing their bodies in new ways to challenge entrenched forms of hierarchy.</p>\n<p>With a focus on the Pacific, Annette Weiner noted ‘many examples of gender complementarity between women and men in terms of hard and soft (cloth) possessions, weaving and warfare’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This interplay is powerfully represented by the <em>ki’iki’i</em> from Rarotonga (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), which brings a hard wooden core together with soft barkcloth wrappings, just as the <em>to’o</em> from Tahiti (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>) combine a wooden core with woven and feather wrappings.</p>\n<p>The paired temple figures of Bhadrakali and Virabhadra, their hard bodies clothed by soft woven fabric, suggests that similar notions of gender complementarity formed part of South Indian religious conceptions, although the introduction of education for girls, even in a kingdom dominated by the famously matrilineal Nair caste, marked a new departure in gender relations.</p>\n<p>Weiner suggested that to read such examples of complementarity as oppositions between male and female ‘is to miss entirely the commingling of symbols and actions that define the political domain for men and women in terms of reproducing relationships and possessions in the face of loss’. Cloth, she suggested, with its ‘acts of tying and unravelling, sacred threads and dangerous dyes, woven warps and unworked woofs’,  ‘may be the most apt metaphor to visualise… expressions of longed for unity juxtaposed against the realities of death, destruction, and change.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If the early mass conversions at Nagercoil were to be followed by the establishment of a Christian society, able to reproduce itself through subsequent generations, schools seem to have provided the institutional form through which its members could be produced. Martha Mault and Charles Mead arguably represent complementary poles underpinning the establishment of this new dispensation in South Travancore, at least when they represented it to supporters elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>At a number of seminars where I have presented initial drafts of some of my work, particularly at the Institute of Historical Research’s Christian Missions in Global History Seminar, I have been asked to say more about the role of women in missionary collecting. This chapter is an initial attempt to respond to these prompts.</p>\n<p>In writing about lace, I was reminded of the late Hélène La Rue, who impressed on me the importance of lace during the year I worked with her on the <em>Other Within Project</em> at the Pitt Rivers Museum, shortly before she passed away. I was interested to find that Nicolette Makovicky and David Hopkin, who were also involved in that project have subsequently developed the <a href=\"https://laceincontext.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lace in Context</em></a> project, which helpfully pointed me towards the Illustrated London News article of 1859.</p>\n<p>I have already acknowledged the influence of those who taught me about South Asian religion and its history, but in writing this chapter, I couldn’t help but be reminded of a tutorial spent discussing ‘Nayar Marriage’, and whether it really counted as marriage, with Nick Allen.</p>\n<p>It seems important to also acknowledge the influence of my students, in conversation with whom I have also learnt a great deal. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Gréine Jordan, whose PhD on the images within the Juvenile Missionary Magazine was submitted just before this chapter was written. My interest in the images used by Missionary periodicals, which finds its way into this chapter, has been stimulated in no small part through supervising her dissertation.</p>\n<p>I would also like to acknowledge Aayushi Gupta, with whom I had a number of extremely stimulating conversations about female Zenana missions in India while she was developing her PhD proposal. This chapter is intended to offer something of a prehistory for that movement.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Contemporary orthography would render this as Kariavili near Mandaikadu</p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> (1837) Demon Worship in South Travancore, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle, September 1837, pp. 441-444: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></em></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> (1837) Demon Worship in South Travancore, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle, September 1837, p. 443: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></em></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> (1837) Demon Worship in South Travancore, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle, September 1837, p. 444: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></em></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> 1 Corinthians 10, 14-22: Authorised King James Version.

The ‘multitudes who had assembled to witness their departure, and to testify their interest in the important enterprise’ cheered in response, ‘the ladies waving their handkerchiefs’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Since his return to London in a whaling ship in June 1834, Williams had toured the country, speaking to missionary meetings about his eighteen years in the Pacific. His <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands,</em> describing events including the conversions of Rurutu, Rarotonga and Aitutaki (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), had been a sensation following its publication a year earlier.</p>\n<p>When it became clear, in December 1837, that the Government would not provide Williams with a ship, he set about raising the necessary funds himself. By January, there was enough to purchase the <em>Camden</em>, a 200 ton, eighteen year old former postal vessel. By the end of March, the <em>Camden</em> had been repaired and fitted up by Fletcher’s boatyard in Poplar, without charge, with a total of £4000 raised in support. This included £500 from the Court of Common Council of the City of London, on the grounds that Missionary work opened the way to British commerce.</p>\n<p>John Williams was the man of the moment and his departure seemed to mark an opening into history. As a new Queen, Victoria, awaited her coronation (on 28 June), the proliferation of steamships and railways across the Kingdom had raised British confidence to new heights. Williams’ biographer and friend, Ebenezer Prout, remembered five years later that:</p>\n<p>To the eye of hope, the future was as bright as the present; not a cloud darkened the horizon, and all seemed to anticipate the day when they would hear of fresh triumphs which he would be honoured to win for the truth and grace of the Lord Jesus.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>George Baxter, who had illustrated Williams’ book, was waiting to document the moment the <em>Camden</em> set sail. Three years earlier he had patented a new technique for printing colour images, used for the frontispiece in Williams’ book, which showed ‘Te Po, a Chief of Rarotonga’ (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), at least in the early editions. When John Snow, the publisher, found he could sell the portrait of John Williams that replaced this in later editions independently, he encouraged Baxter to try something new.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As the paddle steamer approached the <em>Camden</em>, anchored at Gravesend in Kent, the passengers gathered on deck to sing hymns, written for the occasion. They lowered their eyes for prayers, offered by the Rev. T. Jackson, the only surviving Director of the Society who had witnessed the departure of the <em>Duff</em>, just over four decades earlier (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ten missionaries, eight missionary wives, as well as the eldest son of John Williams together with his new wife transferred to the <em>Camden,</em> and Baxter sketched the moment the final sail unfurled as the <em>Camden</em> began to move, water lapping at her bow. For around ten miles, the <em>City of Canterbury</em> continued beside the <em>Camden</em>, allowing him time to finish the sketch, including details of the fully laden ship, with three flags flying from her masts.</p>\n<p>That on the fore-mast carried the Society’s emblem – a dove with a green sprig in its beak and that at the stern features the word ‘Bethel’, ‘house of God’ in Hebrew, the name given by Jacob to the place he dreamed of a stairway stretching between Heaven and Earth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Atop the main-mast, the highest point of the ship, the words on the flag are harder to make out, partly because they are reversed in the colour image and partly because they are not English words. The ‘Ladies of Rev. W. Woodhouse’s congregation, Swansea’ had made a flag for the Camden with the Welsh inscription <em>Cenad Hedd</em>, meaning ‘Messenger of Peace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Baxter worked quickly, turning his sketch into an engraving for the cover of the following month’s <em>Missionary Magazine</em>. It was also used on the title page of <em>The Missionary’s Farewell; Valedictory Services of the Rev. John Williams, previous to his Departure for the South Seas,</em> bringing together the speeches and hymns, with an account of the events of the day.</p>\n<p>There the image of the <em>Camden</em> was printed above a caption ‘<em>And they accompanied him unto the ship</em>’, a quotation from the Acts of the Apostles (20:38), in which Paul addressed the Ephesians at Miletus, since they ‘would see his face no more’. Reviewers of Williams’ book had similarly connected it to the New Testament, declaring it to be a ‘a history of Gospel propagation, unequalled by any similar narrative since the Acts of the Apostles’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In <em>Farewell to Viriamu</em> (the Tahitian version of Williams’ name), a booklet given to those on the <em>City of Canterbury</em>, the first hymn referred to Williams as ‘APOSTLE OF THE ISLES’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The text which followed Baxter’s engraving in the May 1838 <em>Missionary Magazine</em> declared the significance of his departure in national rather than biblical terms:</p>\n<p>England stands pre-eminent among the nations of the earth as a maritime power… But never, since the departure of the Duff, has a vessel left our shores under circumstances and for objects entirely similar to those which have marked the departure of the Camden.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If John Williams was a living Apostle, following a path set by St. Paul, his departure in the <em>Camden</em> demanded commemoration. Working with John Snow, the publisher of <em>Missionary Enterprises,</em> who, together with Prout, remained with Williams on the <em>Camden</em> until it left English waters a week later, Baxter created a colour print to be sold in its own right.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Adverts at the front of Snow’s publications listed this alongside his books as follows:</p>\n<p>Dedicated to the London Missionary Society, price 4s.</p>\n<p>A SPLENDID COLOURED PRINT,</p>\n<p>Representing the Departure of the CAMDEN Missionary Ship, with the Rev. J. WILLIAMS and Missionaries for the South Seas, from the River Thames; sketched on the spot, and printed in Oil Colours by G. BAXTER, Patentee. Size of Print, including tinted board, 10 inches by 14 inches.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The board on which the print was mounted included many of the same details, as well as a title in bold letters, <strong>The Departure of the Camden, Missionary Ship,</strong> the title of this chapter.</p>\n<p>In creating the colour image, Baxter added the <em>City of Canterbury</em> to the right of the <em>Camden</em>, its smoke blowing with the wind.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Comparing the colour image to its black and white precursors suggests that Baxter also added the boats in the foreground, filled with supporters waving hats and handkerchiefs. The way the departing ship is framed by these appears to suggest the <em>Camden’s</em> sails were filled with their cheers, and no doubt prayers, of supporters across the British Isles.</p>\n<p>For John Williams, the departure of the <em>Camden</em> marked just the latest in a series of ambitious maritime voyages. Having regarded the forced sale of the <em>Endeavour</em> in 1823 as a victory for Satan (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), when left without a ship at Rarotonga in May 1827, he decided to improvise.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams began a ship building project soon after he returned to Avarua in July 1827, with the support and assistance of the local ruler, Makea Pori. This must have strained locally available resources, unfolding in parallel to church building projects (Chapter 12), suggesting it was also important to Makea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When a European ship finally arrived at the island in November 1827, Williams wrote to William Ellis in London, telling him about their efforts:</p>\n<p>She is built entirely of <em>tamanu</em>, and about fifty or sixty tons, quite sharp. We have been three months about her, and intend to launch her next week, and start for Raiatea. I call her “The Messenger of Peace”. My first projected voyage is to take not less than twelve native teachers to different islands, go to the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, &amp;c. If you can incline the Directors to give me copper for her, I shall be obliged.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises,</em> Williams described the construction of the two masted schooner, improvising a set of bellows, cutting trees with locally made adzes, and using locally made bark cloth to fill gaps between the planks. Rope was made from hibiscus and sails from sleeping mats. According to Ebenezer Prout, who edited the book:</p>\n<p>It has been frequently said that his own “Narrative of Missionary Enterprises,” is invested with all the romantic interest which belongs to the fictitious “Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,” with the additional power derived from its truth. But it must be confessed that the portion of this work which describes the building of his ship, possesses a fascination altogether peculiar… Defoe never ascribed to the hero of his romance any achievement so wonderful.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>We should remember, however, that while Robinson Crusoe only had “Man Friday” to help him, Williams use of the pronoun ‘we’ included hundreds of experienced Rarotongan canoe builders.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The first attempt to sail the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> resulted in a broken foremast, but after repairs were made, her first voyage was to Aitutaki, 170 miles away, accompanied by ‘the king, Makea’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Like Kamehameha in Hawai’i (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>), Makea seems to have immediately grasped how such a vessel could extend his exchange relationships and enhance his status.</p>\n<p>The <em>Messenger of Peace</em> returned to Rarotonga with a cargo of pigs, coconuts and cats (Rarotonga having been overrun by rats), as well as ‘a considerable quantity of native cloth and mats, which are highly esteemed, and of considerable value at Rarotonga’, obtained by Makea at Aitutaki.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Shortly after their return to Rarotonga, a new missionary, Aaron Buzacott, arrived, bringing with him iron to strengthen the ship. He also brought letters from Ra’iatea, telling Williams that Tuahine, the Tahitian deacon he had left in charge, one of the earliest converts at Tahiti who had assisted Henry Nott to translate the bible into Tahitian, had died.</p>\n<p>Stopping at Papeete harbour at Tahiti, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> sailed to Raiatea, arriving on 26 April 1828, in time for the annual missionary meeting. Makea, who joined the voyage, oversaw ‘the exhibition of the rejected idols of his people’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He then spent two months visiting the important men on the islands of Raiatea, Tahaa and Borabora, with whom he exchanged gifts.</p>\n<p>Despite Makea’s obvious investment in the <em>Messenger of Peace</em>, John Williams’ <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises</em> established the archetype of the shipbuilding missionary, seemingly able to conjure up a vessel with his own bare hands – an association that endured for over a century (Chapter 23).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>From Ra’iatea, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> delivered Polynesian missionaries to the Marquesas Islands and on her return was fitted with further ironwork, sent by congregations in Birmingham. She was also painted with green paint supplied by the captain of the <em>Seringapatam</em>, a visiting British naval frigate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In May 1830, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> embarked on another journey, to what, at the time, were called the Navigators Islands (now the Samoan Islands), stopping in the Cook Islands, where an epidemic was raging. Williams described leaving Aitutaki with ‘ten native Missionaries’ on board, and hoisting ‘our beautiful flag, whose dove and olive-branch were emblematical both of our name and object’ – a note in Williams’ book acknowledging the flag had been made and sent to the Pacific ’by some kind ladies at Brighton… with the work of their own hands’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Stopping at Niue, where they attempted to leave teachers from Aitutaki, an older man came aboard, but when Polynesian evangelists attempted to cover his nakedness,  wrapping a piece of bark cloth around his body, he tore it off, exclaiming:</p>\n<p>Am I a woman, that I should be encumbered with that stuff?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>From Niue, they sailed to Tonga, where Wesleyan missionaries had been working since 1826. During a visit to their mission at Nuku’alofa, it was agreed that Fiji, with its political connections to Tonga, should become a province of the Wesleyan mission.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Travelling to Vava’u,and Ha’apai with the Wesleyans, Williams was shown a <em>marae</em> where five ‘gods, disrobed of their apparel’ were ‘hanging in degradation like so many condemned criminals’. He asked to be given one of these, which he took to England ‘with the very string around its neck by which it was hung’, where George Baxter used it to make an illustration for his book.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At Nuku’alofa, they also met Fauea, a high status Samoan man who had been at Tonga eleven years, who promised to make the necessary introductions if they took him and his wife back to Samoa. As a result, they were warmly received at Savai’i in August 1830. Presents were exchanged with Mālietoa Vainu‘upo and his brother Taimalelagi who were in the ascendent, including:</p>\n<p>one red and one white shirt, six or eight yards of English print, three axes, three hatchets, a few strings of sky blue-bead, some knives, two or three pairs of scissors, a few small looking-glasses, hammers, chisels, gimlets, fish-hooks, and some nails.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Leaving Polynesian missionaries at Samoa, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> sailed to Raiatea, before returning to Rarotonga in September 1831. There the vessel was repaired and lengthened by Makea while Williams worked on translating the gospel into Rarotongan. While there, an extremely destructive hurricane drove the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> onto the shore, and although she survived, seventy sheets of copper were lost. Williams was able to distribute tools, sent by supporters in Birmingham, to assist the reconstruction effort following the storm.</p>\n<p>The <em>Messenger of Peace</em> was not relaunched until May 1832, when two thousand Rarotongans pulled her back to the sea. Returning to Raiatea, Williams was ’perfectly astounded at beholding the scenes of drunkenness which prevailed in my formerly flourishing station’, where many had abandoned the mission during his absence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A war against ‘ardent spirits’ was launched, but Williams soon felt the call to return to Samoa.</p>\n<p>Taking flour, horses, donkeys and cattle to missionaries at Rarotonga en route, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> set off for Samoa in October 1832 with Te-ava, a Rarotongan who had volunteered for missionary service. Visiting a number of Samoan islands, Williams heard many had already abandoned their old practices and were awaiting the arrival of missionaries. Commenting on the difficulty of meeting such demand, Williams suggested in his <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises:</em></p>\n<p>I trust that the day is not distant when Missionaries will not be doled out as they now are, but when their numbers will bear a nearer proportion to the wants of the heathen. And why should not this be the case? How many thousands of ships has England sent to foreign countries to spread devastation and death? The money expended in building, equipping and supporting one of these, would be sufficient, with Divine blessing, to convey Christianity, with all its domestic comforts, its civilising effects and spiritual advantages, to hundred and thousands of people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An appeal for British missionaries for Samoa, where Polynesian evangelists were already at work, became the central focus for the final chapters of Williams’ book. As at other islands in the Pacific, the initial focus for evangelisation was on the overthrow of existing practices, but those in Samoa seemed to be different to the Society and Cook Islands.</p>\n<p>John Williams was told by evangelists about the ‘destruction of <em>Papo</em>… the god of war, and always attached to the canoe of their leader when they went forth to battle’. However, <em>Papo</em> was ‘nothing more than a piece of old rotten matting, about three yards long, and four inches in width’. Although burning was first proposed, new converts agreed that <em>Papo</em> should rather be drowned, since drowning was a less horrific death.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Fauea, who had taken Williams to Samoa, was supposed to tie a stone to <em>Papo</em> before the drowning, but Polynesian teachers intervened, asking that <em>Papo</em> be given to them, so that they could present it to Williams, who according to his book,‘placed it in the Missionary Museum’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Beyond this ‘god of war’, Williams suggested that Samoans ‘generally have no idols to destroy’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Chiefs were nevertheless persuaded to break their taboos by consuming their <em>etu</em>, the bird, fish or reptile to which they were spiritually bound. Williams suggested that ‘like the ancient Miletans’ they expected to die as a consequence, but when no harm came to them, acknowledged ‘that Jehovah was the true God’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On the way back to Rarotonga, having rescued the wife of Puna, the evangelist to Rurutu (Chapter 12), who had been marooned at Niuatoputapu attempting to return to Ra’iatea, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> suddenly filled with water. Assisted by Samuel Henry and the crew of the English whaler <em>Elizabeth,</em> who happened to be at Tonga, the source of the leak was discovered – a hole in the keel which had been filled with mud and stones during the hurricane.</p>\n<p>After several months at Rarotonga in early 1833, where Williams continued working on translating the New Testament alongside other missionaries, he returned to Tahiti in July 1833. Meeting a weaver, sent from London by the Directors, Williams delivered him to Rarotonga before returning to Ra’iatea. When a British whaling ship, <em>Sir Andrew Hammond,</em> arrived at the island, ready to make a return journey, Williams, his wife and three children took berths on board, sailing via Cape Horn.</p>\n<p>Arriving in Britain on 11 June 1834, nearly eighteen years after they had left at the age of twenty, John and Mary Williams discovered a metropolis transforming almost as fast as the Pacific islands they had left. One significant change, after nearly four decades of London Missionary Society operations, was the increased number of people in Britain with experience of overseas postings.</p>\n<p>William Ellis had been Foreign Secretary since 1832 (Chapter 13), Martha Mault had been promoting female education since the previous September (Chapter 14), while other former missionaries, such as Henry Townley (Chapter 6), had returned from India to lead British churches.</p>\n<p>When the income of the Society had fallen off rapidly from a peak in 1830, the Directors recognised the potential for missionary speakers to inspire donations. In early 1833, Richard Knill had been invited by William Ellis to return from St Petersburg in Russia to ‘promote the interest of the Society’ , not only among existing auxiliaries:</p>\n<p>but also to organise new societies, wherever practicable, and thus bring under contribution several extensive districts, which are at present yielding very inadequate pecuniary aid towards the great object of evangelising the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With the abolition of slavery in British colonies approaching in August 1834, Knill’s fundraising had focussed on establishing missions among those who would soon be emancipated. The close links between Missionary work and abolition had been illustrated at the Society’s Annual Meeting in May 1834 which was chaired by Thomas Fowell Buxton, M.P. and leader of the parliamentary anti-slavery lobby.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Three days after John Williams’ arrival in June 1834, around £3000 was raised at an Anniversary meeting of the East Lancashire Auxiliary in Manchester, addressed by Knill.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams was soon enlisted to help, addressing the meeting of the Birmingham Auxiliary in September 1834.</p>\n<p>Speaking at Carr’s Lane Chapel, where ‘Pomare’s Idol Gods’ had been exhibited in 1820, shortly after the construction of the chapel, Williams thanked the congregation for the many gifts of ironmongery they had sent him in the Pacific. It was here that John Angell James, prominent Birmingham minister and, like Williams, a former student at Gosport Academy, first asked him to describe the construction of the <em>Messenger of Peace</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams’ descriptions of the Pacific emphasised its spiritual darkness, dwelling on ‘idol-worship’, infanticide and human sacrifice, but blended this rhetorical <em>othering</em> with what Jane Samson has called <em>brothering</em> – a parallel emphasis on a potential for redemption.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In discussing human sacrifice, Williams asked his audience to imagine their distress if their own husbands and fathers had been selected as a victim, declaring:</p>\n<p>And do not for a moment imagine, my dear hearers, that because these wives, and sons and daughters, are of a different colour from yourselves, that they are without natural affection. ‘<em>God hath made of one blood all that dwell upon the earth’.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alongside speaking at meetings, Williams engaged the Directors in London, persuading them to support the establishment of a theological college at Rarotonga but struggled to get them to take on the expense of a missionary ship. An account of the Tahitian missions, written for the Directors, was printed in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> in April 1835_,_ where he was introduced in relation to a history of sending ‘idols’ home as indications of conversion:</p>\n<p>By the enterprise and diligence of Mr. Williams in conjunction with his brethren, the gospel has been extended to the numerous islands situated to the west and south of Tahiti, where idolatry has been abolished, whence coffins-full of <em>dead gods</em> have been shipped for England, and where flourishing churches now exist.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams acknowledged many challenges, two decades after the initial conversion of Tahiti, including the widespread use of ‘ardent spirits’, but suggested this was not unexpected since:</p>\n<p>Christianity imposes great restraints upon a people who have been habituated to the unrestrained influence of passion; this was restrained while the excitement of novelty lasted, but as soon as that subsided, these restraints became irksome.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, he asserted that ‘in all the lamentable defections, from Christian doctrine and purity… I have never heard of <em>one</em> individual that has ever thought of returning to the worship of their former gods’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the Annual Missionary Meeting in May 1835, Williams reported that the British and Foreign Bible Society were printing 5000 copies of the New Testament in Rarotongan, while the Religious Tract Society were producing 10,000 Rarotongan tracts – ‘little messengers of mercy to send on their embassies of love’. He also appealed for ‘ten missionaries to occupy fields already white unto harvest’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Never lacking in ambition, Williams suggested that in addition to the missions started in Samoa, there remained ‘the Fiji Islands… the Hebrides… Solomon’s Archipelago… New Caledonia; New Guinea; New Ireland, &amp;c., with their adjacent islands.’ He made a case for Protestant missionary societies to coordinate their efforts (partly to exclude Catholics), arguing that the rapid expansion of Christianity in the Pacific was ‘unrivalled in the history of Christian enterprise’, ‘excepting Apostolic times’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the Society’s income for the year after his return reached £53,000, the highest ever, Williams urged supporters to make ‘utmost exertions to raise the funds of the Society from £60,000 to £100,000 during the coming year’. In addition to their usual evangelical middle class circles, he suggested an appeal could be made to the British royalty and nobility, giving them ‘an opportunity of enrolling their names among the friends of the Redeemer and benefactors of the human race’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 5 October 1835, a newly built Mission House was dedicated at Blomfield Street, attended by six new missionary recruits, soon to depart for Samoa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Part of the reason the new building was necessary was ‘the great increase in the business of the Society which has taken place, during the last few years’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1835, in place of its usual portrait, the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> even included a print showing the ‘Elevation of the New London Missionary House’, built on the corner of Blomfield street and New Broad street at a cost of just over £3000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Alongside offices, it had a ‘dry and ample warehouse-room, and a Museum’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Museum, where items presented by John Williams were displayed, was built in surplus land at the back of the building, accessed through double glass doors at the far end of the entrance hall.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During 1836, John Williams continued to tour the country, addressing meetings of Missionary Auxiliaries (often five or six a week), while working on his book. In more informal settings, Ebenezer Prout remembered him bringing out cases ‘of curiosities which he had brought from the islands’ in order to speak at length about:</p>\n<p>A singular medley of idols, dresses, ornaments, domestic utensils, implements of industry and weapons of war; and not infrequently, Mr Williams arrayed his own portly person in the native tiputa and mat, fixed a spear by his side, and adorned his head with the towering cap of many colours, worn on high days by the chiefs; and, as he marched up and down his parlour, he was as happy as any one of the guests whose cheerful mirth he had thus excited. To this exhibition, he would add explanations of each relic; naming and sometimes describing the island from which he obtained it; the use of the object, or the customs connected with it; and various other interesting particulars.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Such items were sometimes given to guests who displayed a particular interest in them, and there are examples in museum collections such as the Field Museum in Chicago and the Auckland Museum, which seem to have been given to Prout by Williams.</p>\n<p>A portrait of Williams was painted by Reginald Easton, a version of which appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> for May 1836.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams also addressed the Society’s Annual Meeting that month, using the history of the Tahiti mission and its past discouragements to provide encouragement in the light of the recent expulsion of missionaries from Madagascar (Chapter 19):</p>\n<p>While the British Christians were praying at home, God was mercifully answering their prayers abroad, for while the vessel was on its voyage to Tahiti, conveying letters of encouragement to the Missionaries, another vessel was on her way to England, bearing not only the glad news of the downfall of idolatry, but also the rejected idols of the people, which were now to be found in the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams recounted donations of coconut oil made by Tahitians in support of the Missionary Society, before appealing to ‘philanthropists, merchants, ship-owners, with British seafaring men generally’, as part of his pitch for a missionary ship. The speaker who came after him suggested it was hard to follow someone who ‘could explain “I have discovered a country; I have arranged a language; I have Christianised a people’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Shortly after this meeting, London welcomed further arrivals from the mission field – John Philip, superintendent of the South African missions, accompanied by Jan Tzatzoe chief of the amaNtinde Xhosa lineage, Andries Stoffels, a Khoe church deacon at the Kat River settlement (established in 1819 for dispossessed Khoe in frontier lands), as well as Mr James Read junior, the son of the Rev. James Read senior (one of the early Bethelsdorp missionaries – Chapter 2) and Sara Elizabeth Valentyn, who was Khoe.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The arrival of three African Christians was a spectacle, inviting comparisons to the visit made by their fellow countrymen over three decades earlier (Chapter 2). Travelled expenses were at least partly met by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Indian-born evangelical Charles Grant (Lord Glenelg), to enable them to give evidence to the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes (British Settlements).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Select Committee had been established by Thomas Fowell Buxton in March 1835, following the abolition of slavery, but arose partly in response to a conflict engulfing South Africa’s Eastern Cape. Its terms of reference appointed it:</p>\n<p>to consider what Measures ought to be adopted with regard to the Native Inhabitants of Countries where British Settlements are made; and to the neighbouring Tribes, in order to secure to them the due observance of Justice and the protection of their Rights; to promote the spread of Civilization among them; and to lead them to the peaceful and voluntary reception of the Christian Religion.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Philip, together with Tzatzoe, Stoffles and Read, addressed the select committee in June – an image of Tzatzoe giving evidence was commissioned from Henry Room, regularly employed as a painter by the Society (Chapter 31). John Willians also addressed the committee in July, and a special missionary meeting was arranged at Exeter Hall for 10 August. An account of the event in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> described the Africans as ‘savage-born, but new-created men’:</p>\n<p>There were men upon the platform, on whom, although differing from ourselves in colour, every eye was fixed with hallowed and intense delight — men, who came amongst us as harbingers of a brighter day for Africa — earnests of an abundant harvest yet to come, and representatives of thousands of their countrymen who have embraced the truths of Divine revelation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Campbell, who had met Tzatzoe on his second journey to South Africa nearly two decades earlier, was keen to remind the meeting of their long connection. Speaking in Dutch, Tzatzoe contrasted long-term conflicts across South Africa with the peace that Christianity promised, deploying his own rhetoric of ‘othering’ and ‘brothering’ to make a distinction between the people in England and the settlers in South Africa:</p>\n<p>Many Englishmen in the colonies are bad, but I will hardly believe that those Englishmen belong to you. You are a different race of men – they are South Africans – they are not Englishmen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Andries Stoffles, also speaking in Dutch, recalled the beginnings of the mission in South Africa, stating:</p>\n<p>I am standing on the bones of your ancestors, and I call upon you, their children, to-day, to come over and help us. Do you know what we want? We want schools and schoolmasters — we want to be like yourselves. You see before you two men of two different nations. You who have put your money into plates, but who never saw the fruits of our labours, I stand here before you as the fruit of your exertions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Read junior, however, reminded the audience of the explicitly political role taken by missionaries in South Africa:</p>\n<p>Your Missionaries have stood betwixt the task-masters and the oppressed, in a country where both the oppressed and the oppressor were degraded almost to the level of the beasts that perish.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>These ‘African brethren’, or ‘African converts’ as they were sometimes known, addressed meetings across the country for several months, frequently speaking on the same platform as John Williams. On 25 October 1836, James Read junior was ordained as a missionary, shortly before he returned to South Africa with Andries Stoffles  on account of their declining health.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tzatzoe and James Read senior, however, remained in Britain another year, during which Tzatzoe’s celebrity continued to grow. His portrait appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> for May 1837, a year after Williams (and following  Stoffles in February).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The following month it was announced that William Cowan had prepared a coloured lithograph portrait of Tzatzoe for sale (one of which survives at the British Museum – 1878,0112.114).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Williams’ book was published in April 1837, he arranged for 50 copies to be sent to members of the nobility, as well as members of the royal family, including the mother of the heir to the throne, who was encouraged to ‘allow your beloved and august daughter to honour the volume with a perusal’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Both Williams and Tzatzoe addressed the Society at Exeter Hall on 10 May 1837, the largest and longest Annual Meeting ever held (at which Charles Mead also spoke – Chapter 14).  Tzatzoe declared:</p>\n<p>If it had not been for the Missionaries there would not now be a Caffre nation; we should have been extinct; the Missionaries saved us. I take this opportunity of thanking the present Government of England… which has given us our rights and returned our country. I shall have very great news to tell my people when I arrive in Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Rev. W. H. Medhurst, who returned from Batavia in August 1836, made a case for the importance of a mission to mainland China, suggesting that a vessel might be launched ’to sail along the coast of China, to be employed not in seeking lucre, but in spreading the blessings of Christianity’ in order to counteract the effects of the opium trade (Chapter 17). <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>Mention of a missionary ship seems to have prompted John Williams to rise from his seat to underline his own case for the Pacific mission.</p>\n<p>Great things had been expected from the Aborigines Select Committee, with John Philip working behind the scenes on the report in collaboration with Anna Gurney (the wheelchair bound cousin of Buxton’s wife, Hannah Gurney) and Sarah-Maria Buxton (Thomas Fowell Buxton’s sister), who worked tirelessly compiling and summarising information from a cottage in Norfolk.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although land taken during the war in South Africa was returned and Governor D’Urban recalled, when it came to the publication of the report in June 1837, in the run up to an election prompted by the death of the King, the more controversial details were excised by Sir George Grey of the Colonial Office. This act of censorship, including the removal of details the humiliating treatment of the body of the Hintza, King of the Gcaleka Xhosa, resulted in a report Anna Gurney described as ‘like a table without a leg’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This appears to have prompted the establishment of the Aborigines Protection Society, which published the original uncensored report in full.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The new society brought together missionaries, abolitionists and humanitarians such as Saxe Bannister, former Attorney-General in New South Wales, who had been an important ally of Lancelot Threlkeld (Chapter 10). The first annual report of the Aborigines Protection Society, declared:</p>\n<p>The abhorred and nefarious slave traffic, which has engaged for so long a period the indefatigable labours of a noble band of British philanthropists for its suppression and annihilation, can scarcely be regarded as less atrocious in its character, or destructive in its consequences, than the system of modern colonization as hitherto pursued.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the society was ‘anti-colonial’ in opposing the political influence of settlers and traders, it remained ‘imperialist’ in its imagination of a humanitarian and Christian empire, within which ‘others’ would be enabled to become ‘brothers’. Krishnan Kumar has suggested that <em>The Making of</em> <em>English National Identity,</em> with its themes of liberty, prosperity and progress, was marked by a ‘Missionary Nationalism’, a key feature of which he suggests is ‘the attachment of a dominant or core ethnic group to a state entity that conceives itself as dedicated to some large cause or purpose’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>We can arguably see this articulated clearly by the alignment of missionary and imperial agendas at the Aborigines Select Committee. Conflicts from the edges of empire had played out in London through the Select Committee, resulting in an apparent victory, despite the necessary concessions made by Buxton in relation to the report.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It soon became time for the missionaries to return to their stations and on 17 October 1837, the London Missionary Society held a Valedictory Service at Exeter Hall to mark the departures of Charles Mead for India, John Philip for South Africa and John Williams for the Pacific. With thirty-five new missionary recruits, the three veterans headed ‘the largest Missionary Company sent forth by the Society at any one period since the sailing of the ship Duff in 1796’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When John Philip addressed the meeting, he directed its attention to ‘the finest collection of natural curiosities which perhaps was ever seen in this world’, displayed since June at Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, by Dr Andrew Smith, following his return from an expedition to explore the African interior, using LMS mission stations as jumping off points:</p>\n<p>look on the walls of the Egyptian Hall, and you will see pictures, of men feeding like brutes – throwing the spear at each other – engaging in rude dances – having no trace of any thing like education or civilisation. While you gaze, you will find it difficult to persuade yourselves that you are looking at human beings. But on the same walls you will see depicted the Missionary stations; and there you will see people decently clothed; having gentleness in their countenances; exercising the habits of civilised life; exhibiting what Christianity is able to effect for a people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>‘Othering’ and ‘brothering’ could be evoked as a contrast in relation to the developing civic exhibitionary complex, remaining deeply entangled with the missionary enterprise. Philip was followed by Jan Tzatzoe, who seemingly embodied this contrast within his own person, thanking the audience for their support before asking for God’s blessing on them.</p>\n<p>John Williams, when he spoke, expressed a hope that the coming Victorian period would mark a period:</p>\n<p>when the Missionary cause will have such a hold on the public mind that the greatest wealth, the mightiest influence, the most brilliant talents, and the highest rank in the British nation, will be consecrated to it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams suggested that in contrast to the warfare of preceding periods, Victoria’s reign might diffuse ‘all over the world the knowledge and blessings of that Christianity upon which our own nation’s superiority is based, and in which the present and future felicity of the human family is concentrated’ – a fairly clear statement of ‘Missionary Nationalism’, although one suspects the nation he had in mind was as much British with English, having been born in England to Welsh forbears himself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams was keen to counteract the ‘speculations of philosophers’ and phrenologists who ‘have been describing the colour, the capacities, the weight of the brain’ with the lived experience of missionaries ‘from among all tribes on the earth’, who could stand before the civilised world and say ‘God has made of one blood all nations of men that dwell upon the face of the earth.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Making the case for the special place of the Pacific mission, Williams suggested that there were ‘between 200,000 and 300,000 people wearing and using articles of British manufacture’, while missions had also made many of harbours safe for British maritime shipping. He suggested that the conversion of Tahiti had been the most important turning point in the Society’s history, as well as the beginning of the current enthusiasm for missions, suggesting:</p>\n<p>Every one acquainted with the history of the Missions must know that the Missionary feeling was at a very low ebb till the importation of the rejected idols of Pomare, and from that time to the present the Missionary feeling has been increasing with accelerated progress.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams ended his speech by declaring:</p>\n<p>We only want one thing, and that is a ship in which to take the voyage. I am not about to appeal to you – from that I am restricted; but I tell you what I want, and you can give it me. I have made application to her Majesty’s government to be supplied with a ship, and I anticipate the pleasure of carrying England’s commerce, civilisation, and Christianity to distant regions, in a vessel the gift of England’s Queen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Explaining that he was yet to have a definitive answer from the Government, he told the meeting £600 had been promised by supporters, suggesting a thousand friends might give a sovereign each, particularly if advertisements were sent to Liverpool and Birmingham.</p>\n<p>Soon after the meeting, Mead, together with the new recruits sailed for Travancore_,_ and on 25 November Philip, Tzatzoe and Read senior returned to South Africa with a new missionary by the name of Gottleib Schreiner and his wife Rebecca Lyndall (the parents of the novelist Olive Schreiner)<em>.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Only on 18 December 1837 did Williams receive a definitive answer from Sir George Grey, confirming it would not possible for the British State to supply him with a Missionary ship because of the precedent it would establish. By that time, Williams’ <em>Narrative</em> had sold over 4000 copies, more than any previous missionary account.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 27 December an ‘Appeal for the Purchase of a Missionary Ship’ was circulated by the Society, and very quickly returned enough to allow the Camden to be purchased for £1600. When a stranger in Birmingham handed him £100, offering two or three hundred more, Williams stated that ‘It was a delightful illustration of the blessed influence which the Narrative is exerting in the country’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In February, Williams discovered that Captain Robert Morgan, an unusually religious captain whom he knew from the Pacific, had just arrived in London, following a shipwreck on Australia’s north coast. Morgan was quickly recruited to take charge of the <em>Camden</em>, which following its refurbishment was opened to visitors at West India Docks for several days before being towed to Gravesend on 9 April, awaiting its departure.</p>\n<p>On the way down the English Channel, the <em>Camden</em> passed the Isle of Wight, depicted in another colour image image published by John Snow, and on 18 April left Dartmouth, where another valedictory service was held. The <em>Missionary Magazine</em> provided updates on the Camden’s progress for readers, including its meeting  with an American whaler in the Atlantic on 2 June.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The <em>Camden</em> arrived at Cape Town on 1 July, remaining for just over two weeks, enabling Williams to visit the Society’s schools with John Philip.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The next stop was Sydney on 8 September 1838, where the <em>Camden’s</em> arrival prompted the establishment of an Auxiliary Society, as well as the production of another image, showing her leaving Sydney harbour on 25 October 1838.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1840, a letter from Williams was published in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em>, written at Tahiti at the end of March 1839, in which he described the missionaries at Samoa looking meagre and emaciated, while those in the Cook Islands had not been visited in three years, underpinning the ongoing need for a missionary ship_._<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It must have come as a real shock when just four months later, in May 1840, the magazine reported the ‘Mournful Death of the Rev. John Williams’, alongside an extract reprinted from the <em>Bengal Hurkaru</em>, published at Calcutta on 12 February, itself taken from an article in the <em>Australian</em> on 3 December 1839. This reported that after a successful landing at Tanna on 19 November 1839, the Camden had visited the neighbouring island of Erromanga the following day. There both Williams, and ‘Mr Harris’ were clubbed to death on the beach. Unable to retrieve their bodies, Captain Morgan had returned to Sydney.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The <em>Missionary Magazine</em>’s cover in June 1840 unusually did not feature an image. Rather, a thick black line surrounded a a printed letter from Captain Morgan, under a headline announcing the ‘Death of the Rev. John Williams’. Morgan explained that James Harris had been on his way to England to volunteer as a Missionary to the Marquesas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At Tanna, Williams evidently remarked that ‘he had never been received more kindly by any natives’, leaving three Polynesian evangelists and one of their sons there. At Dillon’s Bay at Erromanga, Williams, Harris, Cunningham (British Vice-Consul a Samoa), together with Captain Morgan and four sailors had approached the shore in a whale-boat. Morgan described the people as ‘a far different race of people to those at Tanna, their complexion darker, and their stature shorter; they were wild in their appearances and extremely shy’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Throwing beads to encourage them to come closer, Williams had given those on the beach fish hooks and a small looking-glass. After a bucket was filled with fresh water, and coconuts given to those in the boat, Harris had been first to wade ashore. Although no women could be seen and the men seemed afraid, Williams followed, giving sections of printed cloth to those on the beach.</p>\n<p>Next went Cunningham, and when it seemed safe, Morgan. Before Morgan had gone a hundred yards, the boat’s crew called him back, and he caught sight Williams and Cunningham running (Harris was the first to be killed). Cunningham reached the boat alongside Morgan, but Williams ran to the sea and stumbled as he reached the water’s edge, when he was struck by the man pursuing him with a club, before another ‘pierced several arrows in his body’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the boat approached Williams’ body, an arrow was fired into the boat, narrowly missing one of the seamen, followed by a hail of rocks. Returning to the <em>Camden</em>, Captain Morgan ordered a gun to be loaded with power and fired, but the Erromangans dragged Williams’ body out of sight.</p>\n<p>The Editors of the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> were quick to remind their readers that ‘awful and inexplicable as is the dispensation, let the church be still and know that He who has permitted the early fall of his devoted servant is GOD. Though all must mourn, let none complain.’ This account was followed by an appeal to increase the Society’s income to £100,000 during the coming year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In July, ‘An Appeal on Behalf of the Widow and Family of the late Rev. John Williams’ on behalf of the Directors of the London Missionary Society was announced, while an article appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> under the title of <em>The Martyred Missionary</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By August, the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> announced that Ebenezer Prout was preparing a <em>Life of the Rev. John Williams, Missionary to the South Sea Islands,</em> and it seems that his other old friend, George Baxter, likely began his own project of commemoration at around the same time.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In early May 1841, a year after news of Williams’ death had reached London, newspapers announced the publication of:</p>\n<p>The PAIR of splendid PRINTS, in Oil Colours, representing the deeply-lamented Missionary, THE REV. JOHN WILLIAMS, Landing at Tanna, and the last day of this devoted Missionary’s life at Erromanga.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They were sold for one pound, five shillings each, and purchasers of the pair were promised a description by J. Leary, one of the survivors of the massacre, as well as ‘an Account of the Islands when visited by Capt. Cook and Capt. Dillon’. According to the accompanying pamphlet, on hearing news of the death of his friend Baxter ‘thought he could not better evince the sincerity of his regret for the loss of his friend than by dedicating his art and labours to perpetuate the memory of so estimable a man’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Unlike <em>The Departure of the Camden, Missionary Ship,</em> which had been published by John Snow, these prints were published by Baxter himself. While <em>The Departure of the Camden</em> was dedicated to the London Missionary Society, Baxter promised a contribution from the profits of these new prints to the ‘fund now being raised for Mrs Williams’, having already given fifty guineas ‘as a kind of ‘first fruits’’, before the prints went on sale.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By comparing Baxter’s published image of Williams’ death on Erromanga to an annotated watercolour sketch, as well as Webber’s 1785 image of the death of Captain Cook, the Australian art historian, Bernard Smith, suggested that Baxter deliberately made the Erromangans darker in complexion and the missionary ‘more heavenly’ in order to ‘suggest the saintliness of Williams and the spiritual depravity of his murderers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Smith suggested that the ‘remarks’ inscribed on the sketch ‘clearly sought to make the illustration more amenable to evangelical taste’, however it is not clear that they all fulfil this purpose. It is possible that at least some recorded remarks made by someone who had actually witnessed the scene, such as J. Leary, whose eyewitness account was printed to accompany the images.</p>\n<p>Two notes state that the men attacking Williams ‘should be in deeper water’, which may simply be a question of accuracy since an evangelical interpretation of being in deeper water might bring those responsible for Williams’ death closer to baptism. Other notes, selectively quoted by Smith appear to be slightly more ambiguous than he suggests: ‘William I think is more Heavenly in the other sketch, on ?Triate’s Paper he fell forward, not backward’ while another states ‘The Natives. Dark complexion’ and ‘group attacking Harris in the Brooke’.</p>\n<p>In making Baxter’s depiction of Williams’ death at Erromanga representative of missionary presentations of the ‘ignoble savage’,  ‘a squat, swarthy, highly emotional type of being completely lacking in any personal dignity’, Smith ignored the image that was originally published along with it, that of Williams at Tanna.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In this, a barefoot Polynesian teacher in trousers and a shirt stands on a plank linking the dry land to the missionary boat, gesturing towards Williams while looking at a local chief. Williams is shown standing at the front of the boat ‘with his hat in hand, waiting for permission to land’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> When the two prints are placed alongside each other, although the scenes on the beaches are very different, the outline of the coast and the mountains in the background suggests a considerable degree of lateral symmetry.</p>\n<p>In fact, the two prints were created to be displayed alongside each other, and the scene at Tanna suggests an alternative possibility for Erromanga. Baxter himself referred to the relationship between the two images as a ‘melancholy contrast’, with the same boat, ‘natives’ and Missionary, ‘but alas! In how changed a position’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Part of the visual symmetry that links Baxter’s images relates to the sky behind Williams. This is suffused with bright light, suggestive of missionary rhetoric which regarded overseas mission as a means of shedding light into darkness.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By including cloth, mirrors and boxes of provisions in the boat at Tanna, Baxter connected this ‘enlightenment’ project to the charitable gifts made by British supporters of the mission, just as he included them in his <em>Departure of the Camden, Missionary Ship</em>. Missionary work overseas was depicted as a charitable gift.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If the scene at Tanna depicts the welcoming acceptance of this gift, the ‘massacre’ at Erromanga illustrates the opposite: a gift violently rejected. In his essay on <em>The Gift</em>, Marcel Mauss suggested that while those involved in gift exchanges are in theory ‘free agents’, in practice they have an obligation to give as well as to receive: ‘To refuse to give….just as to refuse to accept, is tantamount to declaring war; it is to reject the bond of alliance and commonality’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Erromangans’ refusal to receive the charitable advances of Williams dehumanised them in comparison to their neighbours at Tanna, and this difference is visualised by Baxter’s depiction of their physical appearance. According to Baxter’s description of the scene at Erromanga ‘every countenance [is] expressive of the most diabolical malice and rage…they all seem intent on the work of death’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> His use of the word ‘diabolical’ suggests that Baxter may have regarded the Erromangans as motivated by satanic forces, just as his contemporary Mead saw evidence for the work of the devil in South Indian religious practices (Chapter 14).</p>\n<p>It would be easy to exclusively concentrate, like Bernard Smith, on Missionary forms of ‘othering’, since the description and depiction of gruesome pre-Christian practices such as human sacrifice formed an important part of missionary rhetoric, deployed in fundraising campaigns such as those of John Williams, as well as in Missionary publications. To do so without recognising their mirror image – the ‘brothering’ described by Jane Samson, premised on a project of redemption and reform – would be to fail to acknowledge the full picture – the light alongside the shadow – and would arguably simply position missionaries themselves as ignoble ‘others’.</p>\n<p>Given regular Missionary insistences that all humans were ‘of one blood’, words taken from the English Bible (Acts 17:26) where they form part of St. Paul’s speech to the Athenians, as a motto by the Aborigines Protection Society, we can begin to recognise Missionary ‘othering’ as not primarily racial, but rather essentially spiritual. Spiritual depravity marked the absence of a connection to God, a condtion to which Europeans, including South African and Australia settlers, could be as vulnerable as non-Europeans.</p>\n<p>Baxter’s depiction of the chief at Tanna with an elaborately wrapped loin cloth and a white feather in his headdress, carrying a finely worked club that is more a sceptre than an offensive weapon, is suggestive of his peaceful intentions, but it was presumably also intended to suggest his openness to the possibility of salvation. Without such openness, marked by an acceptance of what Mauss called ‘the bond of alliance and commonality’, evangelical mission, even when underpinned by the practical resources offered by a missionary ship such as the <em>Camden,</em> remained an impossible project.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>Missionary ships have long been something of a fascination, seemingly capturing evangelical enthusiasms in artefactual form. I was lucky enough to be awarded a Caird Research Fellowship  at the National Maritime Museum to pursue the topic in 2015.</p>\n<p>Gréine Jordan began her collaborative doctoral research with the National Maritime Museum in 2018, which she has recently successfully completed. Central to her thesis was the parallel between the John Williams missionary ships and the Juvenile Missionary Magazine, both launched in 1844. This chapter is intended to supply the prehistory for that complex.</p>\n<p>I am very grateful for the ongoing guidance and maritime input of Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritme History at the National Maritime Museum, as well as John McAleer, who reminded me to always italicise ship names while writing this chapter! John was kind enough to give this chapter a close reading and I am extremely grateful to him for spotting the various typos which had infiltrated the text…</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>(1838) Departure of the Missionary Ship Camden for the South Seas, <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle for May 1838,</em> p.247: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5PUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=RA1-PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5PUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=RA1-PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> ; Rev.

It was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September 1936 issue of <em>Survey Graphic</em>, titled “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work. This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more picture by Lange.</p>\n<p>Since it was first published, this composition, best known as <em>Migrant Mother</em>, has come to represent not only the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the 1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time.

With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (<em>Liberty Leading the People</em>), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her <em>Peasants’ War</em>).</p>\n<p>Owens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.</p>\n<p>Several Lange images from the same photoshoot with Owens and her children exist <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/migrant-mother/introduction\" target=\"_blank\">in other collections</a>.
