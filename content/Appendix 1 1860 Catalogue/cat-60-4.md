**ADVERTISEMENT.**


It is hoped that a view of these “trophies of Chris-
tianity” will inspire the spectators with gratitude to God
for his great goodness to our native land, in favouring us so
abundantly with the means of grace, and the knowledge of
his salvation ; and at the same time, with thankfulness that
these blessings have, in some happy degree, been com¬
municated, and by our means, to the distant isles of the
Southern Ocean. Many of the articles in this Collection are
calculated to excite, in the pious mind, feelings of deep
commiseration for the hundreds of millions of the human
race, still the vassals of ignorance and superstition; whilst
the success with which God has already crowned our labours,
should act as a powerful stimulus to efforts, far more zealous
and extended, for the conversion of the heathen.
