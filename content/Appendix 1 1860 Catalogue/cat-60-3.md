THE articles which compose this Museum were supplied
chiefly by the Missionaries employed by the London Mis-
sionary Society; a few others are donations from benevolent
travellers, or friendly officers of mercantile vessels. The
Missionaries rightly judged that the natural productions of
the distant countries in which they reside would be accept-
able at home, especially to their juvenile friends, and to
others who may not have opportunity of viewing larger
Collections. The efforts also of natural genius, especially
in countries rude and uncivilized, afford another class of
interesting curiosities ; whilst they prove how capable even
the most uncivilized of mankind are of receiving that in¬
struction, which it is the study of the Missionaries to com-
municate.

But the most valuable and impressive objects in this Col¬
lection, are the numerous, and (in some instances) horrible,
IDOLS, which have been imported from the South Sea
Islands, from India, China, and Africa; and among these,
those especially which were given up by their former wor
shippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry
—a conviction derived from the ministry of the Gospel by
the Missionaries.
