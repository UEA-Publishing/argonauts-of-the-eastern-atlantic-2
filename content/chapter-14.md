Around 300 Christians gathered in the early morning at a temple ‘in a beautiful grove of jack and Palmyra trees, and surrounded by several fine banyans’.[^⁠2] At its heart were two reclining figures, six feet long and made from sun baked brick, plastered with chunam (highly polished plaster).

According to the Rev. Charles Mead, who returned to England soon afterwards, they represented Pattera-Kalee (Bhadrakali) and Veerapathiran (Virabhadra), female and male emanations of the wrath of Shiva, with ‘faces painted to give them a terrific appearance’. Their faces were soon removed with an Indian spade (mamatee). While paid labourers cleared ‘the rubbish’:

> We retired to the veranda of the temple, sung a Tamil hymn, read the tenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, addressed the people from the twentieth verse, and concluded with prayer. The people were delighted with the overthrow of the the idols; and subsequently began daily to assemble to hear the Scriptures read, and to join in prayer, where satanic worship was once performed. After the service was over, the image of Paramasattee was brought out of an adjoining room, and we rescued it from the flames with a view of bringing it to England, where it has safely arrived.[^⁠3]

Returning to his Mission House at Neyoor (Neyyoor) ‘before the sun was very powerful’, Mead found that Martha and Charles Mault, fellow missionaries from Nagercoil just over eight miles away, had come to see him before he left:

> When reviewing what the Gospel had effected for Travancore, since we first entered the field, we could not avoid saying, and our friends in Britain will join in the exclamation, ‘What hath God wrought!’.[^⁠4]

Mead clearly detected the hand of God in the changes he had seen over two decades in India, regarding his own part in these as contributing to a long-term war against what he called ‘satanic worship’. Indeed, the verse he preached at the temple comes from a letter that was written by St Paul to the people of Corinth during the first century AD.

It warns them not to consume sacrifices made at idolatrous altars, since these had been made to demons. Pointing out that consumption of the eucharist underlies the fellowship of Christians, Paul told the Corinthians ‘I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons’.[^⁠5]

Charles Mead had originally been appointed to succeed William Tobias Ringeltaube, a Prussian minister trained at the University of Halle who established the London Missionary Society’s mission in South India. Born in 1770, Ringeltaube’s missionary ambitions were inspired by John Newton (Chapter 2 & 12), going first to Calcutta in 1796 with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.[^⁠6] He returned to Europe in 1799, complaining that he had been forced to preach in Portuguese to ‘a mixed congregation of Portuguese, Malays, Jews and Chinese’.[^⁠7]

Ringeltaube was appointed by the London Missionary Society in 1803, along with four others intended for India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). They arrived at the Danish colony of Tranquebar (Tharangambadi) in December 1804, where Pietist missionaries had been operating since 1706. Seeking guidance from another German-speaking SPCK missionary, John Caspar Kohlhoff, Ringeltaube began learning Tamil before taking responsibility for Palamcottah (Palayamkottai) in Tinnevelly (Tirunelveli), on behalf of Kohlhoff.[^⁠8]

Around this time, Kohlhoff seems to have introduced Ringeltaube to Maharasan Vedamanickam, a Christian convert he had baptised some years earlier. Vedamanickam came from Mylaudy (Mayiladi) in the Kingdom of Travancore (now part of Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district), close to India’s southern tip. Ringeltaube began paying regular visits to Vedamanickam’s village, ultimately assisting him to begin building a Church in 1809.[^⁠9]

The Kingdom of Travancore had been in a subsidiary alliance with the British East India Company since 1795, but conflict over a new treaty in 1805 enabled the Company to consolidate its influence. The Company’s resident, Colin Macaulay, was the son of a Church of Scotland minister and brother to Zachary Macaulay, one of the leaders of the evangelical campaign to abolish slavery in London. It was presumably Colin Macaulay who negotiated with the Maharaja of Travancore for the permission for Vedamanickam’s church.

In 1812, Ringeltaube moved to Mylaudy, but facing health problems, in 1816 he ordained Vedamanickam and sailed to Ceylon. He evidently planned to recover in South Africa, but seems to have died en route.[^⁠10] Although Mead never met Ringeltaube, it was into his shoes that he stepped when he arrived in late 1817, his first wife having died on the journey.[^⁠11] He found the Church had thrived under Vedamanickam’s care, with seven chapels, five or six schools and around 900 converts and candidates for baptism.[^⁠12]

Macauley had been replaced as the Company’s local resident in 1810 by another reforming Scot, John Munro, who was appointed Dewan (Prime Minister) of the Kingdom of Travancore between 1811 and 1814. Munro retained considerable influence at the court, and persuaded the young Rani (Queen Regent), Gowri Parvati Bayi, to provide Mead with a bungalow at Nagercoil, four miles from Myladi, as well as 5000 rupees to purchase rice fields to support the seminary he proposed to establish.[^⁠13]

This patronage formed part of the official embrace of missionary education by the Kingdom of Travancore, in parallel with the 1813 alteration to the East India Company’s charter (Chapter 6), which had introduced an obligation to introduce ‘useful knowledge’ as well as ‘religious and moral improvement’.[^⁠14]

In 1819, Mead was joined at Nagercoil by Charles and Martha Mault (née Mead, who evidently traced her descent from Britain’s seventeenth century Puritan leader, Oliver Cromwell).[^⁠15] Charles Mead and Charles Mault divided responsibility for surrounding villages between them, but it was only after the visit of George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman in 1827 (more below) that Mead moved to Neyoor, in the mission’s Western division.

​An image of ‘Pattera-Kalee and Veerapathiran’ was printed on the cover of the _Missionary Magazine and Chronicle_ in September 1837, under the title ’Demon Worship in South Travancore’.[^⁠16] Mead’s account of destruction, quoted above, was printed beneath this image, but its source is unclear since the figures are shown standing, while his description suggests those destroyed were reclining.

The appearance of such images on the title page of the _Chronicle_ was a fairly recent innovation. Although the quarterly _Missionary Sketches_ had featured striking images on its covers since its first issue in April 1818 ([Chapter 4](https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/)), the monthly _Evangelical Magazine_ continued to feature just a single portrait each month, a practice established with the magazine in 1793 ([Chapter 2](https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/)). This had continued even after its title expanded to _The Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle_ when a distinct _Missionary Chronicle_ section was added at the end of the magazine in June 1813.

In June 1836, however, an editorial addressed ‘To the Members and Friends of the London Missionary Society’ appeared under a banner, _The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle (relating chiefly to the Missions of the London Missionary Society)_. This stated that the _Missionary Magazine and Chronicle_ would now be made available independently, but still continue as the final section in _the Evangelical Magazine_. Some surviving copies of _the Missionary Magazine and Chronicle_ after this date have different page numbers to those included with _the Evangelical Magazine,_ as well as an issue number and date included as a header (compare the covers for 1836 to those from 1837 shown here), but otherwise appear to be identical.

A significant change introduced in 1836, however, was the addition of a cover image for the _Missionary Magazine and Chronicle._ The first image, for July 1836, shows a rather dramatic scene at Kristnapore, a Missionary Station in Bengal, with the title ‘Peril from the Boa Constrictor’.[^⁠17] Flooding caused by hurricanes seems to have displaced an 18 foot long snake into the mission compound, where it was rather dramatically killed and its skin sent to the Missionary Museum in London.

The October 1836 cover featured a depiction of ‘Worship of the Serpent in India’, followed in March 1837 by an image of ‘Serpent Charmers’.[^⁠18] It seems likely that this recurring serpentine theme may have been initiated by an issue of _Missionary Sketches_ back in April 1833, where the cover featured ‘Representations of the Serpent-God Worshipped in India’, with images of two carvings from the Missionary Museum.[^⁠19]

That on the left, where ‘the hood of the serpent forms a kind of screen behind and canopy over the form of the idol’, was sent by John Hands, LMS missionary at Bellary (Ballari) between 1810 and 1841. The other,  ‘designated _Nagur Swamy_ \[Naga Swamy\], the serpent-god, is among the renounced idols that have recently arrived from Travancore’.

The text which follows begins by declaring that ’The serpent appears to have been one of the earliest objects of idolatrous worship, and has been held in universal veneration’. From the ‘mythology of the Chaldeans and Egyptians’ to the ‘uncivilised aborigines of South America’, the serpent was declared to have been ‘regarded with superstitious reverence by a large portion of the human race, especially in the eastern parts of the world’, with the _Naga_ described as ‘among the thirty thousand imaginary gods of India’.[^⁠20]

The text then includes a description of Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet’s visit to a temple in Allahabad in August 1826, where they encountered an ‘idol’ in the form of a five headed serpent. It explained that Nagercoil, the location for the main LMS mission in South Travancore, literally translated means temple of the serpent. Visited by Tyerman and Bennet in July 1827, their account of the weekly feeding of resident snakes by priests was also printed, including their unsuccessful attempt to purchase one of the foot-high serpent representations from the wall of the temple. These were described as mostly ‘offerings presented by women, in consequence of vows which they have made to the god’.[^⁠21]

The text that follows notes that in the last six months of 1831, 113 families from Nagercoil had renounced Hinduism, seeking Christian instruction at mission schools now responsible for teaching between 16,000 and 17,000 students. At Neyoor, a further 3000 people were said to have ‘forsaken heathenism’, with 160 families added during 1831 alone.[^⁠22]

While Charles Mead remained the sole European male missionary resident at Neyoor, the text explained that he was assisted by an Indian ‘superintendent of schools, fourteen readers, and twenty-six assistant readers’.[^⁠23] Mead’s 1832 report referred ‘to the village of Paenguddy, where the inhabitants delivered up the serpent-idol, represented in the first page of this sketch’.[^⁠24]

_Missionary Sketches_ was quick to remind readers that:

> Every instance in which the objects of heathen veneration are either discarded or destroyed, should excite our devout thanksgiving, and impart greater fervency to prayer, while we regard it as an earnest of the arrival of that period, in which, referring to the purposes of the Most High, it is declared “the idols he shall utterly abolish.” These indicate that God is working by the means now employed for effecting this…[^⁠25]

An excerpt from Mead’s report summarised his efforts to establish a school house at the village of Careavilly (Kariavili) in the grounds of the temple, referred to as ‘the principal devil house in these parts next to Mundacadoo’ (Mandaikadu).[^⁠26]

Mead explained that some of the owners of the temple had converted to Christianity, and the school house was intended to become a focus for Christian worship during the evenings. He thought that the ‘Pagoda will no longer be used as a place of heathen worship’ but would either be removed or allowed to decay, suggesting that ‘the latter is thought to be the most advisable mode of rooting out idolatry from the place’. Mead explained:

The heathen hold the pagoda in great veneration, and if any thing was done that looked too much like a triumph over them, it might be resented and occasion opposition.[^⁠27]

A much bolder approach seems to have been adopted at what seems to have been the same temple a mere four years later, according to Mead’s account of destruction from the _Missionary Magazine and Chronicle_ of 1837. The overall strategy of converting the temple into a location for Christian worship, however, seems to have remained the same.

The final paragraph from _Missionary Sketches_ in April 1833 provides an insight into the preoccupations of those responsible for commissioning the multiple serpentine images for LMS publications in subsequent years, suggesting:

The extensive and valuable labours of the native readers, the numbers under Christian instruction… and the attentive behaviour of the native congregations in places of worship, unite to endorse on every disciple of Christ more fervent and persevering prayer, for the influences of the Holy Spirit a savour of life… and thus to accelerate the arrival of the period, when the worship of the serpent, and every other delusive idolatry promoted by the great destroyer of our race, who, under the form of a serpent, introduced sin and all its degradations and penalties to our world, shall be discontinued…[^⁠28]

For British Christians like Charles Mead, raised on an account of temptation and fall in which a serpent played the leading role, it must have been obvious that the reverence paid to snakes in the form of _Naga Swamy_ at places like Nagercoil was a form of ‘devil worship’, indicating the ongoing influence of Satan, ‘the great destroyer of our race’.

In describing the annual festival at nearby Mandaikadu in 1837, Mead emphasised that it was a ‘place of devil worship’, describing a ‘swinging machine’ which hoisted devotees using a ‘hook inserted in the back’. He described how children who had recovered from illnesses were made to dance with ‘a thin piece of cane inserted in their side’, even hinting that the resident ‘demon’ was said to require a human sacrifice every thousand years.[^⁠29]

Missionary work, situated in this way, was understood as a contribution to a very long-term cosmic battle, in which conversions and the renunciation of ‘idols’ suggested the scales might be tipping.

Mead’s account of the destruction of the ‘idols’ at Kariavili, printed in the _Missionary Magazine and Chronicle in_ September 1837_,_ was followed with news of a Memorial, presented to the Governor of Madras by over two hundred local British residents, protesting at ‘Government Support of Idolatry in India’, referred to as ‘this dark blot on the Christian character of the British nation’.[^⁠30]

The next article described the ‘Conversion of Roman Catholics at Salem’, also in South India, followed by an extract from the journal of Indian evangelists at Chittoor, as well as a ’Translation of a Sermon Preached at Benares’ (Varanasi).[^⁠31] The issue’s focus on India was rounded off with brief news of missions in South Africa and Berbice (now part of Guyana), as well as an anniversary Missionary meeting in Manchester that raised nearly £3,000. The magazine ended by listing a series of more modest financial ‘Missionary Contributions’, as well as letters received from overseas Missionaries.[^⁠32]

The following month, the _Missionary Magazine and Chronicle_ returned to ‘Demon Worship in South Travancore’, continuing Charles Mead’s ‘account of this decaying but abhorrent superstition’.[^⁠33] On the cover an apparently accurate image of ‘Paramasattee’ was printed, with which Mead had returned to London, imagined under a Banyan tree at night, small flames rising from the many spoon-shaped attachments attached to her front.

Mead’s account resumes:

The name Paramasattee literally signifies, ‘heavenly virtue, or strength.’ This demon, though frightful in appearance, is accounted no less a personage than the wife of heavenly Seevan \[Shiva\]. The image, which is formed of wood, was usually concealed from public view, except on great occasions, when it was brought out and worshipped in connection with Pattera-kalee \[Bhadrakali\]. There is a great assumption of mystery connected with the worship of this evil spirit.[^⁠34]

Mead seems to have derived much of his understanding of the function of this image from a former priest at the temple, described as ‘a very interesting man, more than seventy years of age’, who was now ‘a converted character’ following baptism as a Christian. He seems to have told the missionary that the many spoon-shaped vessels were used as lamps, holding oil and wicks, lit during temple festivals to create ‘an imposing appearance, when placed in the shade of a banyan tree, on a dark night’:

These lamps are intended to represent the letters of the alphabet, which are repeated when the image is worshipped; and there are several Tamil letters carved on the image itself. Five of the letters are held as sacred and mystic, and the very repetition of them, it is said, ‘consumed the sins’ of a certain Rajah: they form the mysterious word, Na-ma-se-va-ya.[^⁠35]

According to Mead, when the figures of Pattera-kalee (Bhadrakali) was destroyed, the same former priest told the people:

You used to come to the pagoda with your offerings, and ask me to dance before the idols until the evil spirits came on me; then I would tell you what to do. It was all false and wicked; but we did this until the Missionaries and the native teachers came to enlighten us. Now by the blessing of God our eyes are opened. Some of us have long since abandoned the devil’s service. I am glad I am no longer his slave. Let us be stedfast, and endeavour to show others the true way to salvation.[^⁠36]

While it may be tempting to regard the destruction and removal of religious artefacts as a straightforward imposition of colonialism, this probably fails to recognise the degree to which these events emerged from the actions of people like this former priest, as well as Vedamanickam, who began the process of conversion in South Travancore before European missionaries came to his village.

Arriving in Britain at the end of March 1837, Charles Mead was able to attend the London Missionary Society’s Annual Public Meeting at Exeter Hall in London on 11 May. It proved to be the largest and the longest annual meeting of the Society’s four decades long history. It was attended by a fair number of people with overseas missionary experience, in China (Rev. W.H. Medhurst – Chapter 16), the Pacific (Rev. John Williams – [Chapter 12](https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/), & 15), South Africa (Rev. Dr. John Philip, Rev. James Read and Jan Tzatzoe – Chapter 15 & 31), Madagascar (Rev. J.J. Freeman – Chapter 19), as well as several others who had worked in India ( Rev. Richard Knill, Rev. E. Crisp, Rev. J. Crowther – a Wesleyan Methodist, Rev. George Gogerley, Rev. William Campbell).[^⁠37]

The meeting began with a report from William Ellis, Foreign Secretary (Chapter 13), who provided a listing of the society’s missions, summarised numerically into three columns in the printed account of the meeting; ‘stations and outstations’; ‘missionaries’ and ‘assistants, native, &c[^⁠38]:

|     | Stations and Out-Stations | Missionaries | Assistants, Native, &c. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| South Seas | 50  | 21  | 70  |
| Ultra Ganges | 5   | 7   | 5   |
| East Indies | 310 | 36  | 375 |
| Russia | 3   | 4   | 1   |
| Mediterranean | 1   | 1   | –   |
| South Africa and African Islands | 31  | 29  | 21  |
| West Indies | 28  | 16  | 10  |
|     | 428 | 114 | 482 |

These figures make it clear that the East Indies stood out in comparison to other regions, partly because of the number of ‘stations and out-stations’ (310), but especially because of the large number of ‘Assistants, Native. &c.’ (375). While the second and third columns assert an essentially racial distinction between European ‘Missionaries’ and local ‘Assistants’, it is clear that in India, unlike the other regions, there were ten times more ‘Assistants’ that ‘Missionaries’. The East Indies also had the largest number of European ‘Missionaries’ (36) with seven more than in ‘South African and African Islands’ (29), but there were over 300 more ‘Assistants’ in India (375) than the South Seas (70), which has the second largest number in that column.

The first person to address the Exeter Hall meeting after Ellis was James Montgomery from Sheffield, a journalist who had edited the journals made by Tyerman and Bennet as part of their deputation tour of LMS mission stations, published six years earlier. He noted the need for missionaries in the West Indies following the abolition of slavery (Chapter 18), ongoing conversions across the Pacific, the difficulties of pursuing a mission in China (Chapter 17) as well as in the ‘wilderness of South Africa’ (Chapter 16), but suggested:

In India, within the last forty years, there are evidences that the chains of caste, as well as Satan’s 300,000 representatives under the name of idols will be done away there, as well as in other parts of the world.[^⁠39]

Next to speak was Charles Mead, reflecting on twenty years in Travancore, and the opposition he faced from ‘The Brahmins – the rich, the mighty, and the noble’. He reported that at his mission at Neyoor, a copy of the New Testament had recently been presented ‘to every native Christian on the station, who was able to read’. He also told the meeting that each of the eighty villages connected to Neyoor and Nagercoil had a place of worship and a school, with 6000 boys and 200 girls currently under instruction.

At the end of his speech, Mead provided a slightly different account of the destruction at the temple in Kariavili to that printed the following September:

The people wished me to attend a meeting for the purpose of destroying a large temple, containing two images. On my arrival, I found them all assembled and very much interested. They said, “The evil spirits, which these images represent, have been long troubling the neighbourhood, and several of us have for some time given up our idolatry. Now we wish these relics to be entirely removed, but no one has the courage to do it.”[^⁠40]

Mead apparently told them that ‘we would have it removed’ only ‘if they could show it was their property’. He was given ‘the signatures of eighteen persons, saying they would freely give up the temple to us, to do what we pleased with it’, ending his speech with a mention of Paramassattee:

The other image was a wooden idol – the people wished to burn it, but, as it was rather portable, I proposed to bring it home, telling them, that when you saw that they were casting away their idols, it would be some proof to you of their desire to become true Christians.[^⁠41]

It seems that Christianity may have represented a new form of freedom for many converts, liberating them from inherited forms of power, including the powers of what were referred to as ‘evil spirits’. Nearly a quarter of a century later, readers of the Juvenile Missionary Magazine were told of Paramasattee, the ‘tall, curious looking wooden idol’ shown on the left of an image of the case of ‘The Buddhist and Other Idols’ at the Missionary museum, that:

“Ignorant and unwise,” the simple people stare with wonder at this strange sight, and are quite ready to believed that Paramasattee is indeed a great god.[^⁠42]

The testimony reported by Mead, however, seems clear that temple images were not regarded as gods in their own right, but rather as representations or and vessels for spirits, as in Polynesia ([Chapter 13](https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/)). Nevertheless, there remained an understandable nervousness about being the one to wield a spade against them.

On his return London, Charles Mead presented Paramasattee as a battle trophy in the cosmic war against Satan. European missionaries working in India at around this time, however, seem to have been fully aware that the adoption of Christianity by large numbers of people in South Travancore emerged from a series of far more immediate and local conflicts.[^⁠43]

The majority of early converts in Travancore belonged to caste groups that were at the time referred to as Shánar (known since 1921 as Nadar), as well as Pariah (Paraiyar). These had a fairly lowly status within the Kingdom, which was dominated by Nair (or Nayar) and Brahmin caste groups, who had developed a range of ways of asserting their status. These included various forms of compulsory labour, including at temples, but also prohibitions on lower castes wearing clothing above the waist, carrying umbrellas, wearing shoes or golden ornaments.[^⁠44]

When converted Christian women began wearing clothing on their upper bodies, this was regarded as asserting a privilege properly reserved for the higher castes. Violent confrontations as well as legislative responses followed after 1827, and it was not until 1859 that Nadar women in Travancore gained the legal right to cover their breasts, although not in the same way at Nair women.[^⁠45]

Concern for the lives of women seems to have become a significant dimension of early missionary work at Nagercoil, driven in no small part by the arrival of Martha Mault. She established a girl’s boarding school in 1819, although female education seems to have been regarded somewhat suspiciously, including by many new Christians converts, at least initially.

In 1821, Martha Mault began to teach lace-making to her female students, after they had learned how to read and write. By 1827, there were forty girls at her school in Nagercoil, twelve learning lace-making.[^⁠46] Mault’s efforts have been connected to contemporary British gender ideologies of ‘women’s work’, emphasising ‘separate spheres’ as part of a ‘mission of domesticity’, but they also appear to have been underpinned by a series of fairly practical aims.[^⁠47]

Firstly, the sale of lace created a source of income that supported the costs of running her school. Secondly, lace-making was seen as a way to enable enslaved girls to build up a financial surplus with which to purchase their liberty. Girls in this position were evidently prioritised when it came to teaching these skills, and by 1830 Martha Mault reported that eight girls had emancipated themselves in this way.[^⁠48]

Many former students from ‘Mrs Mault’s school’ went on to become the wives of Christian ‘Native teachers’ as well as village school mistresses in their own right.  While many more boys than girls were educated at mission schools in South Travancore, Martha Mault’s educational project, combining literacy with needlework, seems to have struck a chord with women across Evangelical networks all over the world.

Groups of British women came together to fund the education of particular girls – by 1830, 22 girls were supported in this way.[^⁠49] Some of these girls were even given names by their supporters, possibly to commemorate deceased female relatives and friends. ‘Ladies’ at St. Neots, the town in Huntingdonshire where Martha Mault grew up, raised £2 and 5 shillings each year ‘for the support of “Sarah Franklin”’.[^⁠50]

When Charles Mead spoke at Exeter Hall in May 1837, he told the meeting:

I have in my hand the writing of a little girl, named Elizabeth Fletcher, who is supported by the church at Stepney. It is the second Epistle of St. John, and it is written on a palmyra leaf, with an iron pen. It is novel sight in India, to witness females reading and writing, but their parents are now anxious for their instruction.[^⁠51]

Considerable funds were also raised for Travancore schools beyond Britain. A donation of £12 from Leonora Gaussen on behalf of the ‘Ladies Association for Female Education’ in Geneva was received in November 1837,[^⁠52] followed by a further £14-10 in March 1838.[^⁠53]

Richard Knill, who initially travelled to India with Charles Mead and assisted him establish the mission at Nagercoil, was appointed as a minister at St Petersburg in Russia by the London Missionary Society after his return to London in 1820. His congregation raised funds for the Nagercoil mission,[^⁠54] continuing even after Knill returned to London in 1833.

A key supporter of the LMS was Sarah Biller (née Kilham), who formed part of an influential group of evangelical (and Quaker) women in the city.[^⁠55] Another St Petersburg Quaker, Daniel Wheeler, appointed to manage Russian imperial farms by Tsar Alexander, felt called to visit missions in the Pacific, setting off with his son in late 1833, only to return in early May 1838.[^⁠56]

Martha Mault herself returned to Britain in September 1833, ironically perhaps, at least partly to arrange for the education of her own five children.[^57] Nevertheless, she used the opportunity to raise funds and solicit interest in ‘female education’ in India.[^⁠58]  Following her return to Travancore in October 1835, she arranged for a circular letter to be printed at Nagercoil, to send to her supporters.[^⁠59]

One of these, dated 7 September 1836, has survived in the archives of the Council for World Mission in London, having been sent to the Foreign Secretary, William Ellis. The first printed line reads ‘My dear Madam’, although the last word has been crossed out and replaced with Sir, suggesting that Ellis was probably the only male recipient of one of these letters.[^⁠60]

Mault reported that when she returned, there were 62 boarders and 10 day scholars at her school in Nagercoil, but 38 more boarders were soon added. Miss McGregor, who returned with her in 1835 in order to marry the missionary Charles Miller, soon established her own school at Neyoor with a further 35 students. Mault reported that by September 1836, they had between them 145 girls ‘under our immediate inspection’, with a similar number taught at village schools.

The circular acknowledges that ‘most of the higher castes are still averse to having their daughters instructed’ but suggested that ‘as the benefits of education become more apparent by its wider diffusion among the lower ranks, the higher will be compelled to educate their daughters too’.[^⁠61] The final paragraphs of the letter explained that each girl was instructed for four years, unless they needed to stay longer, but that ‘the simplicity of their food and dress enables us to keep a girl at the trifling expense of forty five shillings per annum’.

Following their visit to Nagercoil in 1827,  George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman noted:

We are most highly gratified with the state of the general aspect of this Mission… There is nothing, as far as we have seen, equal to it in all India, and we were strongly reminded of what we had so often witnessed in the South Seas.[^⁠62]

They also noted:

The girls’ school, under the care of Mrs. Mault (of whom we cannot speak too highly), is in an excellent state, and does her exertions much credit. Twelve of these girls learn to make lace, some of which is exceedingly well done…[^⁠63]

Although Tyerman and Bennet were thwarted when they attempted to acquire an ‘idol’ at the temple in Nagercoil, they do seem to have been presented with a sample of locally made lace by Martha Mault. It survived, pinned to a note written by George Bennet describing its source, at the headquarters of the Council for World Mission in London, where I encountered it in August 2010.[^⁠64]

As an artefact, this fragment, now at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich in London (Chapter 32), has the potential to say at least as much about the early Travancore  mission, with its complex and changing dynamics of caste and gender, as the figure of Paramasattee, now kept on the other side of the river Thames, at the British Museum.

It finds a curious echo in a length of lace from the collection of the V&A Museum in South Kensington, where a printed green label states ‘London Missionary Society, Lace Industry, Nagercoil, S. India’ ([V&A T.195-1993](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O315374/insertion-unknown/)). Below this, a hand-written price in Rupees suggests that it was purchased in India, perhaps with the intention of using it as a decorative edging. How many other examples of Nagercoil lace survive in museum collections, without such labels, incorporated into other garments?

Annette Weiner, who undertook doctoral fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands, six decades after Bronislaw Malinowski, found he had significantly underestimated the role played by women in the Kula exchange system, described in his famous 1922 book _Argonauts of the Western Pacific._ While men were concerned with enhancing their status through the exchange of shell valuables, women developed an elaborate technology for ‘making wealth out of dried banana leaves’, which Weiner came to regard as paralleled by female practices of textile production all over the world.[^⁠65]

Introducting her 1992 theoretical book, _Inalienable Possessions_, Weiner suggested that:

In many societies throughout the world, however, women are the producers and, in part or wholly, the controllers of highly valued possessions – a currency of sorts made from “cloth”. Intricate symbolic meanings semantically encode sexuality, biological reproduction, and nurturance so that such possessions, as they are exchanged between people, act as the material agents in the reproduction of social relations….  
Historically, women’s control over these arenas has accorded them powers associated with magical potency, sacred prerogatives, political legitimacy, and life-giving and life-taking social controls.[^⁠66]

Lace making in England, like the production of banana leaf fibres in the Trobriands, can be regarded as involving the production of ‘a currency of sorts made from “cloth”’. In the East of England, where Martha Mault came from, lace-making was linked to the history of Protestantism, having arrived with French and Flemish refugees from continental wars of religion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Lace formed an important and valuable part of middle-class female dress, with inherited items of ‘antique lace’ treasured as family heirlooms, playing a role in key English life-cycle ceremonies – baptisms, weddings and funerals. During the nineteenth century, although lace making was increasingly mechanised, making lace by hand survived ‘as a means of occupying spare time’ among middle class women.[^⁠67] Indeed, work produced in this way was increasingly sold to generate funds to support missionary work.[^⁠68]

Alongside a description of mechanised lace-making in Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, Friedrich Engels observed in 1844 that hand-made lace continued to be commercially produced in Northampton, Oxford and Bedford, where lace ‘schools’, effectively small-scale workshops, exploited the children of the poor. Summarising, he suggested:

This is the price at which society purchases for the fine ladies of the bourgeoisie the pleasure of wearing lace; a reasonable price truly! Only a few thousand blind working men, some consumptive labourers’ daughters, a sickly generation of the vile multitude bequeathing its debility to its equally “vile” children and children’s children.[^⁠69]

Did the introduction of lace-making in South Travancore simply mark the expansion of similar forms of exploitation to an Indian context? A century later, Mahatma Gandhi deployed the production of Khadi cloth by hand as a symbol of dignity in labour as part of the _swadeshi_ movement. Is it implausible to suggest that lace-making as form of economic self-empowerment within the female-directed educational setting of ‘Mrs Mault’s school’ at Nagercoil, suggests something similar may have been at play in missionary contexts?

At the end of her book _Inalienable Possessions_, Annette Weiner argued that:

Understanding the scope and limits of gender-based power in the ethnographic record demands giving serious attention to the essential domains in which women participate in economic and political actions in their own right with their own resources. Since the ethnographic examples from which traditional economic theories are formulated rely almost exclusively on examples of men’s production and men’s exchanges, the reproductive energies in such things as women’s bones, sacred cloth, hair strings, banana-leaf bundles, weaving poles, and birthing houses, are largely unrecognised or, when recorded, are reduced by anthropologists to prosaic categories lacking economic or political provenience.[^⁠70]

In moving from the destruction of temple sculptures to the production of lace, I have attempted to demonstrate some of the ways in which these seemingly distinct practices remained intimately connected. The transformations associated with the widespread adoption of Christianity by marginalised castes in South Travancore pitted the temple, a focus for existing ideas and practices surrounding fertility, where many dedications were evidently made by women, against the school, where at least some women gained new forms of economic power, clothing their bodies in new ways to challenge entrenched forms of hierarchy.

With a focus on the Pacific, Annette Weiner noted ‘many examples of gender complementarity between women and men in terms of hard and soft (cloth) possessions, weaving and warfare’.[^⁠71] This interplay is powerfully represented by the _ki’iki’i_ from Rarotonga ([Chapter 12](https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/)), which brings a hard wooden core together with soft barkcloth wrappings, just as the _to’o_ from Tahiti ([Chapter 4](https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/)) combine a wooden core with woven and feather wrappings.

The paired temple figures of Bhadrakali and Virabhadra, their hard bodies clothed by soft woven fabric, suggests that similar notions of gender complementarity formed part of South Indian religious conceptions, although the introduction of education for girls, even in a kingdom dominated by the famously matrilineal Nair caste, marked a new departure in gender relations.

Weiner suggested that to read such examples of complementarity as oppositions between male and female ‘is to miss entirely the commingling of symbols and actions that define the political domain for men and women in terms of reproducing relationships and possessions in the face of loss’. Cloth, she suggested, with its ‘acts of tying and unravelling, sacred threads and dangerous dyes, woven warps and unworked woofs’,  ‘may be the most apt metaphor to visualise… expressions of longed for unity juxtaposed against the realities of death, destruction, and change.’[^⁠72]

If the early mass conversions at Nagercoil were to be followed by the establishment of a Christian society, able to reproduce itself through subsequent generations, schools seem to have provided the institutional form through which its members could be produced. Martha Mault and Charles Mead arguably represent complementary poles underpinning the establishment of this new dispensation in South Travancore, at least when they represented it to supporters elsewhere in the world.


Acknowledgements

At a number of seminars where I have presented initial drafts of some of my work, particularly at the Institute of Historical Research’s Christian Missions in Global History Seminar, I have been asked to say more about the role of women in missionary collecting. This chapter is an initial attempt to respond to these prompts.

In writing about lace, I was reminded of the late Hélène La Rue, who impressed on me the importance of lace during the year I worked with her on the _Other Within Project_ at the Pitt Rivers Museum, shortly before she passed away. I was interested to find that Nicolette Makovicky and David Hopkin, who were also involved in that project have subsequently developed the [_Lace in Context_](https://laceincontext.com/) project, which helpfully pointed me towards the Illustrated London News article of 1859.

I have already acknowledged the influence of those who taught me about South Asian religion and its history, but in writing this chapter, I couldn’t help but be reminded of a tutorial spent discussing ‘Nayar Marriage’, and whether it really counted as marriage, with Nick Allen.

It seems important to also acknowledge the influence of my students, in conversation with whom I have also learnt a great deal. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Gréine Jordan, whose PhD on the images within the Juvenile Missionary Magazine was submitted just before this chapter was written. My interest in the images used by Missionary periodicals, which finds its way into this chapter, has been stimulated in no small part through supervising her dissertation.

I would also like to acknowledge Aayushi Gupta, with whom I had a number of extremely stimulating conversations about female Zenana missions in India while she was developing her PhD proposal. This chapter is intended to offer something of a prehistory for that movement.
