While 2022 marks the centenary of the publication of Malinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific, for me it also marks ten years since I completed my by PhD thesis, and twenty since I submitted my MPhil thesis. Both were produced digitally in the age of the internet, yet submission necessitated printing and binding of endless sheets of paper. Both theses have had far more readers in their digital form on Academia.edu.

Pandemic conditions since 2020 have witnessed a shift in University life, with dissertations increasingly submitted and examined exclusively in digital form.

Encouraged by academic colleagues to generate a scholarly monograph on the museum and collection of the London Missionary Society, on which I have been working since 2006, whenever I sat down to do this, I struggled with the constraints and process of paper-based publication.

This is my attempt to give my research a form that makes sense.
